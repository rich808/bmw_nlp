My 07 335i,So my check engine light came on the other day and threw 2 codes twice. So it said 1 code twice and another code twice. One code was p0238 and I cant remember the other 1 but when I do a pull and when boost starts to fully kick in it stutters and shakes violently and goes into limp mode. Someone help me please. I cleaned the map sensors yesterday and they didnt look bad at all. I'm guess vacuum leak maybe,E90,1582117887,scrubbblord,34,1,True,2020-02-19
Vacuum line leak?,"So my check engine light came on and said my map sensors are bad. But I took them out and they didn't look that bad so I cleaned them with electronic cleaner and installed them back and still same issue.

This might sound stupid...,"If you’ve seen my last post- I recently bought a e93 as my first car. That being said, I’ve had a lot of hate from “friends” and random strangers from my city. I typically don’t care what they yell at me about being a “spoiled rich kid” but recently it’s been causing me some anxiety due to other stress and mental health issues. I also tend to stand out because of the horrible “N” sign I’m required by law to stick at the rear bumper stating I’m a new driver.

Being an e93- it’s not at all expensive or even a flashy car I suppose. I wish I could tell them that every financial responsibility is in my own hands, though I don’t think it’s even worth my time.

E92 328i codes,"sorry for the generalized title, I didn’t know what to put. I just bought an 08 328i from an auction lot. It was doing perfect until one day I gave it some good gas to beat a light, I felt a pretty bad misfire, and the check engine came on.

I got it read at an O’Reilly’s and apparently there was 21 different codes.

- cyl 3 misfire
- cyl 6 misfire
- power management electronic monitor (2DEB)
- power management battery monitor (2DEC)
- coolant temp sensor range (2EE6) (MIL)
- misfire at low tank (29D9)
- transmission fluid deteriorated (578E) (ACTIVE)
- lost communication gateway modus (CF17) (STORED)
- external solenoid supply low (5720) (ACTIVE)
- internal tcu failure processor lr. 3 (5726) (STORED/MIL)
- supply voltage too low (93D0) (STORED)
- DSC button 10 sec (5E5B) (STORED)
- volts drop below 9 (5DF4) (STORED)
- brake lining HA (5DE1) (ACTIVE)
- brake lining VA (5DE0) (ACTIVE)

Rest were duplicate codes

Now the brake lining and transmission fluid are obvious, but I was wondering about the rest.

Seems like it needs new plugs/coils for the misfires, but the others all seem like some electrical issues. Could it need a new alternator or battery?",E90,1582238761,mCProgram,5,1,True,2020-02-20
Loud *click* or *snap* when applying brakes," So I've been experiencing this for a couple months now and haven't been able to diagnose it. It does not happen all the time, in fact it's really inconsistent which is what makes it difficult to diagnose.  


It sounds like a metal on metal \*tap\* Kinda high pitched and noticeably loud. It's just a single click right at the start of applying the brakes. It doesn't seem to have any affect on braking performance that I can tell. Also it seems to happen more often when switching in to reverse and then hitting the brakes but it does happen when moving forward as well. Not sure if connected at all but it seems like it happens more when the brakes are warmed up from city driving, but it doesn't happen much during the first few cold minutes of driving.  


I just finished removing &amp; reinstalling the caliper clips and confirming that the caliper bolts and caliper carrier bolts are all tight. Still happens.

Timing chain, starter, spark plugs and a lot of other little things which added up. I’ve had a few other cars since my bmw like a civic si, I’ve drove my parents accord brand new, my sisters Lexus is250. In my opinion nothing has came close to the driving experience as the bmws I’ve owned.  But every tine I bring up the idea in the back of my head I knew how much of a bitch it was to maintain.

Poor Gas Mileage on N51 328i xDrive,"Lately I've been getting poor gas mileage. As in, under 25 on the highway. I've got no service lights. I did get an O2 sensor code last year, but I cleared it and it never showed again. The car has about 135k miles on it. 

I have new spark plugs (&lt;15k miles on them). My tires are inflated properly. I had the VANOS cam bolt warranty work performed last year, and no codes have been thrown since then, so I assume they did the job correctly. I did have to replace the starter, and I put new intake gaskets on the intake manifold (everything torqued to spec).  The valve cover gasket has been replaced with the VANOS cam bolt warranty. 

I change my oil every 8k miles or so. There isn't any sludge in the engine.  

Whats the next steps that I should take to determine what the issue is? Should I just change out the O2 sensors since they're high mileage? Is a compression test in order (but wouldn't that throw a code)? All of the spark plugs are gapped properly, and there isn't any misfires. 

Every now and then, I do notice that the engine likes to rev a little bit up and down around idle when I'm at a traffic light, which makes me think that the engine might be running a little lean.

Drove my car on 4L of oil,"I have an Australian 323i at 130k km. I spent the weekend replacing the valve cover gasket and valvetronic motor seal. I also did a complete oil drain and replaced with Castro Edge 5W-30 just to try it out. But after I replaced the oil filter, I did not seat the oil filter oring properly. The black big one at the end of the thread. So naturally after giving it a test drive, the oil pressure forced the badly seated oring open and squirted entire intake side. However I only realised it after going 20km to the gas station and back. Just to fully warm up the car. I was in a little rush so I didn’t check the engine bay while testing driving but rather feeling for changes in the throttle etc. I am quit inexperienced as you can tell. The spill is not a hard fix. I’m just gonna soak up as much as I can and give the under plate a wash next week. 

BUT I am deeply worried about my engine since it had to run on basically 4L of oil for like 30Km. With like 10 or so redline revs at neutral and a few 4grand revs going up some hills. I had to add 1.25L of oil twice so total 2.5L was added till max oil. I basically fixed the oring. Torqued the cap properly, drove for 5 mins says I need oil. Added 1.25L, idle said full, but after 10 mins of driving. It gave me a red below min warning again. I topped up another 1.25L on the side of the road and drove for another 15 mins to home and it said Full the whole time.

2008 BMW E90 335i - Idle Surge,"Hi everyone, I've been having a throttle problem with my 2008 BMW 335I w/N54 engine. The car turns on but the engine does not idle correctly. I've checked for vaccum leaks and could not find any. I pulled the codes with my scanner tool and I am getting codes 2D09 and 2FCB both throttle body related. I have tried resetting adaptation (foot pedal method) countless times and it doesnt seem to fix it. I have another 335i that is working fine. I swapped out throttle body to see if that would fix it and it didn't. I connected the car to INPA and tried resetting all the adaptations and that did not help either. I don't know what else to do at this point. What could be causing the idle surge? I've done a bunch of research and it seems like its an electrical problem. I just can't seem to pinpoint it.

1M style bumper cover replacement,"My bumper is good and fucked, was looking for m style bumper replacements and happened upon the 1m style.

I have already fallen in love with the design, but I have a few questions.

The online forms steered me away from duraflex/fiberglass/fiberglass enhanced plastic, but there’s still a few options.

One from “Coture” which says urethane in the name and seems to be the most widespread at around 5-700

A discontinued one from “KBD Urethane” which only has a few listings left for 7-800

One from “Vicrez” on their own site, for 1400

And obviously the original on ltmw, for 1750

I’m not really looking to spend over a 1000 on this (paint isn’t an issue), so I was just wondering if the coture or the kbd urethane ones have bolt up fitment as I wouldn’t like to take it to the body shop.

I can’t find a single review or photos anywhere of the coture bumper except the repeated ones on product pages.

KBD seems to be legit but does not offer it directly on their site anymore so that makes me a bit weary. Multiple car forms verify quality.

Vicrez seems to be on and off, not taking their own photos, some shady stuff, but a few fourms from different platforms had decent success.

LMTW is obviously the gold standard, nothing but good reviews, trusted, etc.

Battery Questions,"Hi guys 328xi 2011 6speed,

I know my battery is not ""New"" per se, like it hasn't started in a few -30 to -35 degrees Celsius in the past two winters but in general when it warms up and all through the summer I have no issue with it.

Anyhow, I brought it to the dealer recently as I had them do two recalls on it and had the FRM module replaced in warranty. The car sat in their yard for 2 days in very cold temps and started fine when I went to pick it up. It ran 2 hours all the way home (live 2hrs away from nearest dealer) and now that I am stuck home with the coronavirus the car has sat in the driveway for like 5-6 days. Usually its fine I even started it 6 days ago just to move it in the driveway and parked it there no issues.

Came to the car this morning, couldn't even unlock it, measured voltage on the battery it was at 8V...

Hooking up a charger to it the only way I was able to bump voltage up was to force the smart charger into 2A and 8A continuous modes, can a battery just suddenly die? Or am I looking at the possibility of some parasite or short somewhere that is draining it?

Thanks",E90,1585526719,MaTArcher,16,1,True,2020-03-29
Noxem review,"I've had [Noxem](https://bimmerprofs.com/shop-noxem129-130/) installed in my car for a couple thousand kilometer now so I'll write a review about. It's a NOx sensor emulator for the N53. I paid for the sensor myself.   
   
I've had issues with my E91 LCI 330i, the engine was jerky/stuttery on cold starts and fuel consumption was quite high, around 10.5L/100km. Upon checking the error codes, I found 30E9, nox cat aging. This means you either need a new nox cat (2000$+) or a way to make the engine controller think the nox cat is doing fine (like Noxem).   
If you don't fix it, your car will use more gas and the fuel adaptations won't be done correctly, leading to rough starts, misfires etc.    
Installing noxem was pretty straightforward, the old sensor was stuck in pretty bad but the physical installation was quite doable. The software side took a bit longer, you'll need a special program (INPA I think), a USB cable and a bit of time.   
Cold starts are now a lot better and fuel consumption went down to 8.5L/100km. The gas savings will outweigh the cost of Noxem after a year, so I'm quite happy with it.

E90 320D remap = HPFP Fault?,"Hey guys,

Bit of a long one but any advice appreciated!

I bought an 09 plate 320D saloon last year and it’s been an excellent motor on long journeys and saved me a lot on fuel costs! Anyways I wanted to try a remap to improve it even further where possible as pretty much all reputable mapping specialist were saying +25BHP (or more) and better fuel economy so it seemed like a no-brainer.

In anticipation of the remap I had the car fully serviced (new glow plugs, new glow plug controller, all filters, oil change, checked for fault codes), forté injector cleaner, oil additive and DPF “cleaner” additive, fresh MOT (no advisories), fault codes checked. Basically everything I could think worth doing to get it in a good position. Everything came back clear after the glow plugs were changed as they were the only fault code. Confirmed they were knackered with a multimeter after they were removed. Oh and a new battery.

Fast forward a month where I’d been happily driving around and got a few quotes for remap. Decided on a chap who has a good online presence with a lot of great reviews from legitimate people including people I knew. He came and remapped it for me while I was at work, he showed me his kit but I have no idea about it so glazed over a bit. Took it for a 10 minute drive and instantly felt the difference in immediate power and smooth delivery. I was chuffed to bits. The next day o was driving to work and decided to put my foot down to overtake a tractor and the car went into limp mode. Had to pull over, red-faced, turn the car off and back on. Lo and behold every time I put my foot down in 3rd or 4th gear it would have a small hesitation, go like the clappers then go into limp mode. Even more so when I was travelling up hill. Couldn’t get it to happen in any other gear and only happened if I rammed my foot down.

I called the chap who did the remap up, he said it was the first e90 he had an issue with since he started mapping. He came back out the next day and put a further modified map on that he said had been tweaked to deliver less power in the areas it went into limp mode. Took it on another drive to the same place the limp happened before and it didn’t happen so i thought great, problem solved!

A couple days later it started happening again so i popped into a garage near my work place to run the diagnostics and it came back with glow plug errors and high pressure fuel pump (HPFP). I knew the glow plugs and controller were brand new so ignored that. In any case the remap chap came back out double checked with his diagnostics and it said the same, glow plug cylinder 4 and hpfp error codes. So he put my original map back on as he had taken a backup of it. That was around 4 months ago and the car has been faultless reliability wise.

I know I should just leave it as is but it’s really bugging me why the map would cause this. Too much stress in the HPFP? I’ve followed his social media and seen 10s of the same model being remapped as mine with no apparent issue. He also gave me a full refund (minus the £20 I told him to keep for driving out several times).

HPFPs seem to cost an arm and a leg so is it worth me even replacing it if I consider a remap? What if it’s not the hpfp at fault?

Has anyone else heard of this?

Thanks

M3 Buying Help.,"Hi all, I'm still new to this sub and to Reddit in general.

I'm looking for advice on whether or not it would be a smart decision to buy an M3. I'm 18 years old and I first fell in love with the e90 at 16 when I received my 2007 328i. Although 99% of maintenance and insurance was paid for by my father, I did all of the work to keep it running. I was forced to sell it after my father didn't want to continue paying for maintenance. As I am graduating High School soon, I have the choice of choosing my next car around the 30k range. An M3 has always been my dream after falling in love with my 328i and I don't know if I should wait to buy one.

Really, I want to ask e90 M3 owners what the cost of long term ownership is like on these. I'm curious about insurance, frequency of maintenance, and other day to day costs.

I'm currently looking at a 2011 comp with 75k miles for around 27k. 

Will owning an M3 bankrupt me? I know I can buy many other newer and much more reliable cars for my budget, yet no matter what I do, I can not get this car out of my head. I will likely use this car for at least the next 4 years and am just looking for advice.

a sulev success story,"I love my 2007 328xi but it does have some issues.

BMW has replaced Fuel Pump, VGC, 02 sensors, MAF, and spark plugs/coils over the last 3 years.

They recently replaced my DMTL pump / charcoal cannister and told me it was due to overfilling.  2 weeks later I'm dripping fuel near the rear passenger side.  I take it back in and they say it was overfilled again and they will replace it one more time - but not again.

I tod them that I haven't filled past 3/4ths of a tank since I got it back, and they insisted it was fixed and to come get it.  10 minutes later I get a call from the shop foreman himsef who asked for more info.  I gave him the rundown and said I suspect a fuel leak somewhere else.  He opened a ticket with BMW and took matters into his own hands.

2 days later they call me and tell me there's a leak in the fuel reservoir and they have replaced it under suev warranty, $4000 saved.  They had never seen the problem and the foreman even thanked me for my research and detailed observations (I suggested it could be a fuel tank leak as  I know it's covered under sulev and I wanted them to investigate everything)

2008 E92 overheating and smoke coming out of air vents,"As the title states my car started having some over heating issues and ac problems recently. This all started a couple of weeks ago. I was in the drive thru and it began giving me the overheating code. Pulled over to let it cool off and eventually drove home since I was close anyway. Around that same time the air vents started giving off a chemical kind of smell, and when I turn the ac on smoke will come out of it sometimes. I took it to my mechanic and he replaced the valve cover gasket, since he said it was leaking pretty badly. He assured me that should fix the issue but later that same day my car overheated again and the smell continued. I checked the radiator hoses for leaks and I found 1 that was leaking a little and I replaced it. Made sure my coolant was full and let the water pump reset. I replaced the water pump and thermostat, as well as the radiator and the fan last year. So I don’t think the problem could be those things.

For anyone who experiences none of the electronics functioning and a ticking noise present around the glovebox,"This morning, I found out the battery was dead along with a subtle ticking noise around the glovebox and the hazard button flashing rapidly. At first, I thought either the frm or the cas module was fried. Using a voltmeter, the battery was at 5.5V. I am still diagnosing how the battery dropped 7V overnight.

First thinking my remote was dead, I opened the drivers door with the physical key and put the fob into the slot. Unfortunately, the fob was unremovable. If anyone did the same mistake as I did, take the physical key out and use that to lock the door if neccessary till it can be jump started.

Luckily, I had another car to use to jump start it using the battery points under the hood (the trunk was inaccessible). After connecting the jumper cables, I was able to remove the key fob and open the trunk.

After getting the engine to start over, I started diagnosing by removing the jumper cables and read its battery voltage. It read 15.5V, which meant the alternator was working.

Now it's either that my battery is bad or something discharged it (leaning over a discharge since the voltage used to stay over 12V all the time). So I decided to disconnect the battery itself to check on its voltage later tonight and possibly rule out a bad battery.

One of the vacuum hoses that goes over the engine under the air box cracked so I replaced both with some from a local auto parts store. When i put the intake manifold back on and torqued the bolts the center part of the manifold where the bolt goes in cracked. I think my torque wrench is not calibrated correctly. (Thanks harbor freight) Put everything back together and added a bit of coolant to replace the lost coolant during the gasket change. Cycled the water pump to get any air bubbles out. Tried to start and battery was just about dead. It turned over and was running rough check engine light came on so I turned it off and put a charger on the battery. Once charged it fired up nice but sounded louder. (I have the bmw performance muffler. Just the muffler not a full exhaust) drove down the street and the back fires were way louder. Usually just a slight rumble on deceleration. This time there were pops. My e92 is stock except the muffler. So I thought wow those vacuum lines must have been leaking for quite some time. Check engine light still on. I have my diverter valves unplugged and capped from the inlet sides so I get a faux bov sound lol. Anyways they weren’t making the usual woosh sound after a mild pull in 3rd in my test drive. From what I can see I’ve plugged in everything and the vacuum lines plugged in.

E92 Rubber/Plastic on inside of boot next to lights???,"[img]https://i.postimg.cc/K1RbPtRb/101-E375-E-5-AEF-4015-92-A8-CE71231-A9163.jpg[/img]

Question about these, the plastic/rubber cover that fits near to the gas struts seems like they don’t fit properly and all the dirt and water that runs off down the channel between the boot lid gets caught and goes into this space underneath potentially causing corrosion. 

Not sure if it was a poor design or isn’t fitting correctly due to previous owner repairing or removing something.

Hopefully these photos show, there is a gap that I’m constantly having to clean out and just doesn’t seem right to me.

E93 BMW M3 going into limp mode randomly,"Hey everyone, hopefully this is the right place to post about something like this.

I have a 2008 E93 BMW M3 in a 6 speed manual transmission. It seems almost randomly the car will go into limp mode. 

I’ll list some of the code I get below in case anyone is familiar: 

———————————————

2B2D: Status: History - throttle flaps initialization Bank 2 

CDC0: Status: History - throttle flap actuator CAN-message Bank 2 

2B57: Status: History - Motor emergency program activated 

2B15: Status: History - throttle flap actuator control monitoring Bank 1 

2B21: Status: History - throttle flap actuator Pre-Drive-Check Bank 1 

2B22: Status: History - throttle flap actuator Pre-Drive-Check Bank 2 

2B59: Status: Intermittent - coolant thermostat monitoring 

5E19: Status: History — DSC-ECU: ECU-internal: Serial-Peripheral-Interface (SPI): ID request not accepted 

 
I’ve researched many forums and Youtube videos about this issue and think it has to be the throttle body actuators. From the codes above, is anyone able to tell which one exactly I need to replace? 

I want to be absolutely sure and diagnose the problem correctly before spending any money on new/rebuilt throttle body actuators or any other parts. 

What gets me is that sometimes just turning off the car and turning it back on will make the car go back to normal and get rid of limp mode. Anyone have any insight?

New Headunit Advice?,"Happy holidays, everyone!

I have a 2008 335xi sedan and I am looking into putting either a hands-free Bluetooth package (for music and calling) into the existing factory stereo (with Logic7) or a new headunit with Apple Carplay in it. My car does not have iDrive, so I do not have a screen to work with. I previously owned an E46 that I stuck a GROM hands-free setup into with that factory radio, but I was ultimately not pleased with the bad audio quality and lack of control that device gave me. I am also trying not to lose the functionality of a CD player. I have seen in forums in years past people not recommending putting aftermarket headunits in due to a lack of control over the vehicle diagnostics, however I have came across some Eonon units that look like they could be worth investing in if they fixed that issue.

My sights were set on a N55 135 DCT for commuting and because the wife and family don't drive manual. Truth be told I was also growing a little tired of doing 40 minutes in stop and go on 3 pedals. Stock power is never enough for me, but I don't do wild mods, FBO would be the absolute upper limit, and likely I would never exceed tune+intake+exhaust.

The question then is: Do I want a 135 DCT or a 335 ZF xHP? I'll still have the truck for moving people and materials, so size is not a concern. I probably don't need AWD/xDrive; again, the truck will do for deep snow days. Seems the 135 is available around 90k miles for $10k and would provide the fizz I am seeking in a weekend car while still being a decent commuter.  The 335 is $12-13k for one with the sport package and similar miles. I'm used to Audi 3.0T(s/c) ownership, and expect the N55 to cost about the same to keep healthy.

Already aware of the suspension differences, token rear seat, and lighter weight of the 1er.

Am I missing anything that would sway my intended purchase?

Powered Seat / Headed Seat,[deleted],E90,1578196472,[deleted],0,1,True,2020-01-04
Powered / Heated Seat Issue,"So, I seem to have a malfunction of the driver seat in my 2007 328i which is causing a few problems. I am posting this because I have seen several people experiencing one of the two problems that I am, but not both simultaneously. Both problems started during the same drive and both involve the same seat, which is why I suspect that they are linked (even though I don’t understand why they would be).

Basically, I noticed today that my heated seat wasn’t working, even though the light was illuminating as it usually would, so I just turned it off and made a mental note to get it checked out. Later, when I parked, I went to lean my seat a bit and it moved about a centimeter before stopping and refusing to start moving again. 

I just went back out to my car (several hours later) to try and see if the problem was persisting, and the heated seat indicators were acting erratic (either turning themselves off or turning themselves down and up) all without the seat heating at all. Also, my seat will still not move while I am sitting in it (I don’t hear the motor), but when I am out of the seat it does move normally.

The car is in good shape with about 138k miles. I have never had problems with the power seat functions or the heated seat functions until today. The seat is original to the car, and I haven’t done anything to it since I’ve had the car. Also, I checked the power seat fuses and they were all fine. I wasn’t able to check the heated seat fuses, though, because I don’t have a small enough fuse puller. I plan to get one tomorrow to test the heated seat fuses.

Any input would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance. 🙏

EDIT #1: OKAY... I had an odd (and frustrating) development. All fuses are fine even though a few are a bit discolored. However, it's now clear to me that my car just hates me.

Basically, everything (the heated seat, power seat, seat memory) all work when I am NOT SITTING DOWN. As soon as I sit down, my seat and side mirrors stop acknowledging seat memory selections, and my heated seat gets erratic and shuts itself off. If I stand back up outside the car or  I hold myself up an inch or so off of the bottom and press my seat memory, then it whirs into place. If I let myself down and try to move it then it'll refuse.

Anyone heard of anything like this? I no longer suspect the power seat motor, as it is holding the same amount of weight wether I am holding myself up off of the seat or resting on the seat, yet it will move without hesitation if I'm not making contact with the seat bottom.

Maybe a wire is being pinched when there is pressure on the seat bottom? Any ideas? I feel like I'm going crazy. Thanks so much.",E90,1578197558,TRVPEDx,0,2,True,2020-01-04

Thoughts on E92 335i xDrive PPI results?,"Hi! I'm hoping to get some feedback on the outcome of a PPI done recently on an E92 I'm looking at.

More details on the car in question here: https://www.reddit.com/r/E90/comments/e90ya9/prepurchase_advice_2011_e92_335xi/

To summarize it's a 2011 E92 335i xDrive, automatic, 80k miles, cold weather + premium + sport packages, listed at $12k.

I brought it to a reputable indy BMW shop for the PPI, and they noted that the rear shocks and front control arm bushings need to be replaced. They also found some oil residue so said they'd need to investigate further to see if there's a leak somewhere. They quoted me about $1500 for this work. Other than that there's also a ding in one of the rear wheel arches that doesn't look PDR-able and lots of rock chips on the front bumper.

I was originally thinking $12k was a decent price if the PPI checked out, but now I'm not so sure given the cosmetic damage and upfront maintenance costs already totaling $1000+. Are my expectations way off here? Would it be reasonable for me to use the PPI results to try to negotiate a lower price?",E90,1578524551,unfloopy,2,1,True,2020-01-08

Am I crazy?,"I have what I think is an irrational fear about my N54 335 and want to get it out on the page and see what the subreddit hive-mind has to say about it. 

Car has 90,000mi on it, is well maintained, with no deferred maintenance. I've got some bolt-ons and JB4 running map5. Car has a DCT. 

MY FEAR: 
I'm afraid of driving it at 10/10ths as far as the powertrain is concerned. I shift when the turbos run out of steam around 5700rpm and rarely go full throttle... maybe 85% tops. The car hasn't had any symptoms of things being fundamentally out of whack in literally years as I was getting my parts to work together properly. Last thing was a hose clamp failing to hold on first time I ran an E30 ethanol blend but then I just upgraded the clamp. I did lose a couple coils at the same time a few months ago and I think that just spooked me since I was 100% throttle in 3rd when things went wrong and all kinds of lights/CEL came on... nothing since. I fear something is gonna let go if I'm really on it!

Am I crazy? Is my concerned warranted? I want to get talked out of this so I can quit driving like a p**** and enjoy my car to the fullest since that's the whole point of these cars.",E90,1578677283,bwhoback,13,1,True,2020-01-10

N51 oil consumption?,"I've got the SULEV N51 engine, and every 4000k miles or so, it burns through an entire quart of oil, requiring me to add a quart to get rid of the warning. Not a huge deal, but annoying. 

Originally, I thought it was just due to the Valve Cover Gasket (VCG). However, it seems thats not the case. 

The VCG has been replaced 3 times under the SULEV warranty, along with the oil pan gasket. First time was VCG replacement, then the Valve Cover itself had a crack a couple months later, which was also replaced under warranty along with the new VCG, then I had the VANOS warranty issue where they replaced again both the VCG and the Oil Pan Gasket. 

I've looked around the valve cover itself since then, and there's nothing that seems to be leaking. Other than performing a compression and/or leak down test to see if its the piston rings or head gasket, what other places should I spray with Brakleen to see if there's any other leaks external to the engine? 

I've read that the oil level sensor tends to have some corrosion issues on the pan, and maybe I need a new gasket there. I plan to look next time I do an oil change, but while it's on stands I want to know what else to look out for. 

Could it be a rear main seal? Any easy way to test that one out?",E90,1579886523,boomjay,34,1,True,2020-01-24

Blower Fan erratic speed on Auto,"Experiencing an issue on my E90 where the fan speed keeps fluctuating between the correct speed to maintain warmth (usually 2/3 bars), and then suddenly speeds up to the fastest or second fastest speed for up to a minute before returning to a good speed, and repeats constantly.

But, this only happens on AUTO (and does not change depending on recirc setting). Fan speed holds true when set manually. For this reason, I'm doubting it is the FSR, rather, leaning toward something such as the solar sensor, AUC or condensation sensor, unless, perhaps, these items would not change fan speed so drastically. Only code (that may be unrelated completely) is 9C6C, suggesting AUC. Have cleared, will wait to see if it returns.

Any ideas before I start throwing parts at it? Since you've read this far, I'll now mention I had the glass replaced 2 weeks ago.

"Bring awareness to the climate control ""REST"" function.","For the first year of my e90 ownership I figured that the ""REST"" button on my climate control was simply for stopping all the vents.

I didn't care because I could just turn down the fan speed all the way to turn off the AC or heat, but I really wish I had known what this button actually does for the last two full winters.

For anyone that doesn't know, this button will actually pump warm air into the cabin for about 10 minutes after the car's engine is turned off (if you are running into a store or the house for a few minutes).

So, next time it's freezing and you will be back momentarily, just turn off the engine, remove the key, and hit the ""REST"" button before getting out. This will keep the car a bit warmer in preparation for your return.

A few things to note: Only use this function if the car is fully warmed up. If it isn't fully hot, when all the residual heat is gone it will be blowing cold air into the cabin until the timer expires.

Vibrations @ Highway,"6Speed E90 2011 Xdrive

Been chasing vibrations on this car for the past year.

Last year was riding on used Nokians I got the car with in the winter the ride was rough, different shops told me some of my stock 17 inch wheels were bent, I got 2 straightened and even bought some reconditioned off rockauto. Never really pinned down the problem. Went on to my summer wheels and it was better but still something. Had the rear driveshaft replaced that year and it was driving better.

This year, had some shops take a look again. First shop said my wheels were ""fine"" or atleast within acceptable tolerance. They told me my ""MOMO"" entry level tires were probably the culprits.

Drove around shaking my teeth between 100-120km/h for a few weeks and decided to hit another shop. They found a rear bearing on the driver's side was shot so I thought finally the culprit! Nope! Drove a bit smoother but still vibrating.. Same shop played around with it we tried a combination of different tires in the rear on my wheels and the car seemed to drive a little better but wasn't able to put all 4 as they only had 2 of my size in stock.

Now I have two shops claiming it must be my cheap Momo tires that all have pretty much an uneven road force when driving around according to them.

The company I ordered them for wants a ROADFORCE Report from the machine to prove they have defects to issue a reimbursement or replacement of the tires and even the test.  
I just keep having second thoughts that my used driveshaft replacement could also be ""better"" than my defective one but its getting costly to have all these shops give me their ""Opinions"".",E90,1581299016,MaTArcher,10,1,True,2020-02-09

2011 328xi - FRM3 Suspected Failure,"Greetings Fellas

Was -30 this weekend and had some difficulties starting car. After several failed attempts to start it I had it on my charger for about 2 hours and was able to start it.

Right away I noticed all interior lighting was not functioning and that the blinkers and windows as well...

Online research and youtube video viewing brought me ton conclude the FRM3 module on my BMW was probably Fried / Corrupted.

Anyone have any experience with this? Whats the first step to confirm that the module is FRIED / CORRUPTED or if a main fuse is just blown?  
I have an INPA cable and access to the software if that may help.

Seeking advice for a E92 2007 335i,"First time poster here, just seeking advice for a possible purchase coming up.

&amp;#x200B;

So I've been always drawn to the E92 body style, and found a very good looking one on CL in my local area.

Note: I'm in Canada so the numbers are in $CAD and KM.

An fellow car enthusiast was selling his older father's 2007 335i coupe with 46,000km (26000 miles) and asking for $13,500 CAD ($10,300 USD). I did a little test drive today and everything seemed mint. Two minor cosmetic dings (1 on mirror and 1 on front right bumper) and 3 claims on CarFax (Front Right Corner) insurance claims as his elderly father had a tendency to bump the car into a protruding corner on the right side of his garage. Reason for selling was that his father had his license taken away due to medical reasons, which accounts for the low KM driven.

So far, the only known maintenance records I have of the car is a ABS module replacement and battery replacement. Now I'm aware of the quirks of the N54 engine (Wastegate, High Pressure Fuel Pump, water pump, fuel injectors, Oil Filter Housing Gasket being the primary culprits) and I am having a friend who is also a BMW mechanic to take a look before I seal the deal. I'm primary putting my judgement in the fact that it's stock, senior driven and extremely low KM driven for the year. My question is this a decent deal ?

Help tracking down an E90 coolant leak?,"09 328i auto with 175k miles.



So I have a newly developed coolant loss. I drive ~40 miles a day and have had my low coolant light come on today for the third time (I'm topping it off each time, just under a half gallon each time or so.) From looking under the oil fill cap I don't believe it is getting in the  oil, and I have driven a three hundred miles or so since I've noticed it. 



From looking both under my car and under the hood, I don't see any obvious spots where it could be escaping. I read the oil filter housing gasket is a common spot, more so on the N54s, but still on the N52 and was going to replace this tonight. If this doesn't fix it, where else should I look?


Other things I've noted, for the past 25k miles I have occasionally smelled burning oil, usually when braking hard downhill, or turning hard. And think I might be faintly smelling coolant now? But it could be the oil I suppose. 

Also this issue just started when it got cooler out and I've been using the heat more, which works great, but has me concerned it may be a leak around the heater core? However, the low light did come on after a couple days where it was warmish and I didn't run my heat.

It all started when I left campus to go home and turned Traction Control and Stability Control off, its basically playmode for the car. I do a couple nice turns, some power-slides, and then I get onto the parkway. Not realizing my speed and driving recklessly as I usually do I attempt to switch lanes to avoid the slow person in front of me. I switch lanes and when i pull the wheel back I notice that my back end is out and I am sliding and currently going 60/70 mph. Im an okay driver but no amount of reverse steering or maneuvers could help me gain back traction due to it being OFF. After doing two and a half 360’s I realized it was me in this car, it wasnt a movie or a youtube video where Ive seen dumbasses do this. I end up in the grass shoulder shaking from relief and im not entirely sure what really just happened. I look over and see many cars slowly driving by and glaring at me for my complete idioticy. Yes I did deserve it and put my life and others in danger, but it was unintentional. Reminder to others to drive safe and dont be me.",E90,1572465732,atatheking,27,19,True,2019-10-30

Cabin/Driveline Vibration Frustration,"Hey guys, I was hoping for some insight on a problem I have had. 
Everything is great with my car until I get onto the highway and hit 80 MPH. Once I hit 89, if I push on the throttle even just a little, I start feeling vibration throughout the cabin. I look in my rear view and it looks like the entire back window is shaking(which I think it’s actually the rear view mirror). 
The more throttle I give, the worse it gets. Once I let off the throttle, it’s gone.

2008 328i n52 timing issues,"Hi everyone,

Having some trouble with my timing, bit of background. I have a 2008 328i N52 141k mi, auto. 

I recently noticed oil leaking from my engine and I had noticed that my aluminum head bolts were snapped off. So I purchased the bolts and the timing kit off FCP euro along with the TDC pin to stick in through the hole by the starter in the engine and lock the flywheel/ engine at TDC. 

When I locked the engine at TDC, also verified that Piston #1 was at TDC by sticking a screwdriver in the spark plug hole, I began to try and set the jig to lock the camshafts into place. But there weren’t sliding in because the camshafts needed to be rotated clockwise( facing the Vanos sprockets looking towards the trunk of the car) a few degrees to be able to bolt the jig down on the cylinder head. So I researched online and found a few people had the same issue. So locking the engine at TDC I unbolted the cam bolts and rotated both cams clockwise to able to lock the cams in place, removed the cam sprockets/ Vanos out of the way and replaced the broken aluminum cylinder bolts. 

Assembled everything back together. Spun the engine by hand a few cycles to ensure everything cleared and nothing binded up. And started right up. 

But I am getting a check engine light with codes of P13b4 and p13b6. I had no check engine light prior to this. So I imagine I set the timing wrong. Car runs fine. Just don’t have a lot of power when I floor it like it normally would. Rough starts when it’s cold but other than that it runs fine 

Back to my original issue trying to see if I could’ve have screwed up when I inserted the TDC pin in the engine to lock the flywheel. I want to double check the timing not sure if there is a TDC mark on the crank pulley I can reference too ? Or if anyone has any suggestions ?

INPA/NCS/Coding &amp; Cable Questions,"Hi Guys,

I have a 2011 328 xDrive 6 speed.

**Cable:**

I had a Subaru USB OBD cable laying around. After doing some research realized I could modify it to suit ""BMW/VW"". It has the FTDI 232RL chip. So I soldered Pins 7&amp;8 and followed the instructions to use MPROG and change the values.

At first INPA did not display Ignition ON and did not detect the cable. (Had not soldered the pins yet and some of my MPROG settings were incomplete.)

Now the cable is ""**detected""** in INPA, and it states **""Ignition On""** which I believe are good steps forward.

**Software :**

* Installed and followed instructions for Bimmergeeks BMW Tools 2.12 (Install, delete folders and replace, etc.) 
* Downloaded a recent version of the E89 DATEN files for my E90/328 2011 but initially did not distribute them to EDIABAS, NCS etc. because I thought they were only used when requested so I would have pointd to them myself.

**Here is my mileage :**

Before coding, most tutorials start by doing a quick ""AIRBAG module read test"" on INPA to confirm the cable is connecting to the car. I get errors when doing this so I tried doing some more simple testing like reading sensor values on the VANOS and such and I get *""No response from control unit""* when reading information on similar items.

In NCSexpert, when entering VIN number I get ""VIN FAULTY"".

As I stated above, during these last tests my E89 DATEN files were not updated in the respective folders so I believe the programs are using the default install files. I've now pasted the files and overwritten before bed last night but have not retested since.

My question is do these errors point more towards a faulty cable, or towards a software issue / daten issue.

Not quite sure what to do here. I have a 2011 328xDrive with 104k and love it.

I've gotten three estimates, all of which are around $3k (brand new doors + paint). Not sure how much it is to get doors from salvage as I havent looked that route yet. With this said, I normally would just get it fixed, but it was a buddy of mine who hit me and they dont want to put it through insurance.

Just adding all the costs in my head and I'm not sure its worth it to put the money in to fix the damage + the other repairs when I could take the money and put it down as part of my down payment for a car.

2007 E90 Coolant drain screw - Where is it?,"A hose popped off while driving home so I lost all my coolant.  I managed to pull over in a neighborhood pretty quick and reattached the hose.  I had to fill the coolant tank with a hose in order to get it home.  I know that is supposed to be a bad idea but I didn't have any other options.

So now I want to drain the coolant and replace.  I watched a number of videos and read some walkthroughs, but when I got the bottom shield off and went under there, I simple could not find the blue drain screw that is shown in all the videos.   I thought it was on the bottom of the radiator (immediately behind the front grill of the car?), but don't see anything there. Am I looking in the wrong place? 

Note: after I got the bottom shield off, I didn't find any additional radiator shield under the silver radiator box like is shown in the DIY instructions.  I don't know if a previous service didn't put it back, or if I'm looking in the wrong place again.  I did remove another small shield from the bottom of the radiator that was held in with two plastic twist T's that go into the slotted holes in the bottom of the radiator. 

I took a bunch of pics (sorry hard to aim well under there), can anybody point out the drain screw, or where I should be looking?  Is it farther back from the front of the car?

Talk me out (or not) of buying back my recently totaled 335i,"Two days ago I was t-boned by a girl who pulled out of a business park parking lot onto the highway without looking. Geico came out today to asses the damage to the car and declared it totaled. The car is a 2008 335i with 131K miles on it. Other than the damage from the accident, the car is in great condition. **ALL** the major repairs and replacements that a 131K mile 335i requires have been done in the last year and I just put brand new Michelin PS4s on it.

After talking with the Geico estimator and receiving the payout and buy back amounts, I'm toying with the idea of buying the car back and either trying to sell it as a complete vehicle, albeit with a salvage title, or parting it out.

The estimator valued the car at $9,782

The salvage buy back would $1201 (what I would pay to buy the car back from Geico)

If I let them take the car I get the full $9,782. If I keep the car I get $8,581.

Am I crazy to think that I could get $2,500 to $3,000 by selling the car as is, even with a salvage title, and make another $1,200 to $1,800?

Only thing i havent chased down is  the TPMS light. Its honestly really nice, its just not white. I really wanted a 335 when I bought this so I rushed and bought one in my least favorite color, with interior im not in love with, and the x variant that means nothing to me (im in the south with no possibility of snow). My car made me realize how much I wish I had bought a 335i, in white, with either black/white/creme interior, LCI.

The problem is that they are asking $15k. With a clean CarFax btw.

The plan has always been to just sell my car and look for what I want, but I've found its super difficult to find the exact options I want together.

Chasing Vibrations...E90 6SPD 2011 Xdrive,"Hi guys, as in title 2011 E90 6SPD 2011 Xdrive, currently 182 000 km on the clock.

**I will try to make it short but its not easy.** I have been chasing a highway vibration on and off for the past year or so. It is most noticable between 110-120 km/h. 

I keep my maintenance up to date, so currently as far as my knowledge goes this car has no ""pending maintenance items"". 

Over the past year I have replaced every single part that needed attention within a week or two of knowing it needs replacement. 

* Running stock 17'' BMW wheels in winter (Used to be on Nokian last winter now trying out some MOMO North Pole WS-2
* Running aftermarket 18'' in the summer on Pirelli 4 seasons.
* In the last year I have replaced/done : Rear struts, all front bushings and steering components, new alignment, all 4 brakes and replaced the rear drive shaft with a low mileage used one.

Different mechanics/garages have claimed different things last year one ""BMW specialized"" garage in my area claimed my stock 17's were the culprit. They had lateral wave on them and so I had them straightened and even bought a reconditioned one off the web. Ride was greatly improved but there still was something left.

Eventually a more acute vibration ADDED to the initial one and that turned out to be a drive shaft so replaced that and the car was riding much much better but STILL something left. I finished winter on the stock 17's and thought hmm maybe I'll diagnose the winter tires/wheels by putting on my summer 18's and seeing if the problem goes away. The 18's seemed to drive a bit better but still a vibration in the chassis coming from rear because there is no steering wheel shake, mostly felt by putting your hand on the headrest of the passenger seat. Ended up working outside of town almost all summer so I stopped worrying about it.

Bought some new tires for winter this year I thought ""This will eliminate the Nokians from last winter being the problem"". Had the MOMO's fitted onto my 17's, ""BMW specialist"" garage balanced them car was shaking very noticeably he REstated that it was my wheels so I bought another reconditioned 17'' wheel and got a reputable tireshop with high tech balancing machines to take a look at it.

He claimed most of my wheels were not perfectly balanced by the other shop he rebalanced them more precisely and the problem is now reduced but back to the initial ""remaining vibration"". They claim my wheels are not bent (contrary to other shop) and decided that the 2oz and 3oz added to two of the wheels was not enough to render them ""problematic"" or responsible for my current issue.

They claim the new MOMO tires are not ""perfect"" and that they are now the culprit in this new shop's opinion. I can't disagree but then again I find it peculiar that the new variable is responsible for an old problem that was exactly the same with 2 other wheel combinations.

Thanks for reading I'd really appreciate some insight with this.",E90,1574339718,MaTArcher,6,1,True,2019-11-21
SULEV,I’m currently looking at a 2011 328xi and it’s marked as SULEV. My state does not have extended warranty for this and I am wondering whether or not this should deter me from purchasing the vehicle.,E90,1574428226,ChadTheChadiest,7,1,True,2019-11-22
Did I buy a lemon?,"I've had my 2011 335xi (60k miles now) for about 6 months and have dumped $3500 into it. Take away the large expense to put tires on it and that's still about $400 per month. Is this just the beginning or is it a bit average?

What I've done so far:  
- MAF sensor  
- MAP sensor  
- TMAP sensor  
- Rear brake pads and rotors  
- Hand brake shoes and hardware  
- New battery  
- New tires  
- Head shield replacement  

With most of the above there was usually some sort of diagnostic cost. Now it's sounding like new injectors are going to be needed soon (very loud ticking and rough starts/idle in the cold weather) and a knocking/grinding noise from the front end that no one can diagnose. The water pump has not been done, nor has the valve cover gasket, HPFP, OFHG, or pretty much any of the other things that are expected between 60-80k miles.

07 335i N54 misfires around 5000 rpm,"Has about 77k on it. When I go for a hard pull with the engine warm and the revs top 5000 the car begins to misfire really badly and will continue to misfire no matter what rpm it's at, I can slow down and baby it below 2000 but any amount of throttle will make the car shake. However turning the engine off and on again immediately fixes it and it will drive great again so long as I keep it below 4500 or so. I've tested this a few times and I can shut the car off at highway speed and immediately turn it back on which fixes the misfire. 

I should mention the check engine light is always on at this point. I scanned it and using Google translate from German I was able to get a rough idea. It says I have a misfire on cylinder one with no specified cause as far as I can tell. I think it also says something about the HPFP. 
Here's a picture of the readout if anyone knows how to make sense of it better than me: https://imgur.com/gallery/4P51eVf

Is this the proper way to see if my HPFP is dead?  


My LPFP is loud as can be like normal, and I am pretty sure I used inpa to see that it was getting voltage and doing something while cranking the engine.  


I guess its too late for BMW to replace it for that recall....

Battery taken out and charged then i got a fault. possible damage anywhere?,"Hey guys! long story short my battery went to 11.7V after sitting in its place for a long time and starter engine couldnt start. Having a battery charger at home i thought i should remove it and charge it at home. After removing it successfully i charged it at home for like 24 hours voltage went up to 12.6-7 it was all fine. Installed it back and went for a test drive. After around 3 kms my car stopped when i was cruising at 40km/h like literally blanked out no electric no nothing as if it was parked on the side with a key out. thank god i was cruising slowly and i was able to pull to the side of the road safely. When i stopped power came back on and i got a fault saying drive failure you may drive slowly etc but i couldnt read it because the fault vanished in like 3 seconds. Anyway i thought may be its a one time thing i continued to drive and it happened again after around 3-4kms power came back on same failure and it vanishes etc. 

I opened the trunk and i checked all the connections to the battery may be something was loose and i found this cable to be literally dangling under the red cap.(cap was closed and the nut was at the top it was barely holding on to the screw)

I didnt test the car yet after tightening all of the screws, do you think i might have damaged anything? im sure i did not cause any shorts i was very careful about it. its just this system over the battery i ve never seen such a thing and that closed cap over the connection fooled me  and stupid me forgot to tighten it :/",E90,1575718500,orhanyor,5,1,True,2019-12-07

Pre-Purchase Advice (2011 E92 335xi),"Hi all! As the title states, I’m looking at a 2011 E92 335i xDrive and am seeking some advice on the possible purchase.

2011 E92 335i xDrive

~$12k

80k miles

Automatic

Cold weather, premium, sport packages

&amp;nbsp;

Seller has replaced the following within the last 3 years and has records for the work done:

-coolant expansion tank, radiator, water pump, thermostat

-oil filter housing gasket

-belt, belt tensioner

-high pressure fuel pump

-AC evaporator

-battery

&amp;nbsp;

Based on the e90post buying guide, it looks like many of the common problems have already been addressed, except the valve cover gasket and oil pan gasket. 

&amp;nbsp;

Questions I have:

-I’m planning to get a PPI, but is there anything else I should ask the seller about specifically?

-Does the price ($12k) sound reasonable? 

-Would I have to change the valve cover/oil pan gaskets preventively?

-Thoughts on changing transmission fluid, and how soon it would have to be done? I’ve read conflicting opinions on this!

-Anything else I'm overlooking or should be aware of?

"Help with electrical issues, random shutoffs?","The car is a 2011 335xi. About 2 months ago I had my battery replaced and coded to the car. Since then I've had some weird electrical incidents...

- A few weeks ago I was taking a left onto a 35mph road and the car completely shut off - engine off, no lights, then after about a second started on its own and kept going with no problems. 
- Then this past week I drove to work, about 15 miles on the freeway, and the car did the same thing while slowly pulling into a parking spot. It didn't restart itself, but it did let me start it when I put it in park and it showed no codes/warning lights.

- Yesterday after about 40 minutes of mixed freeway and city driving with some idling, I had the car in sport mode on the freeway and after some aggressive driving I set the cruise. A few seconds later the traction control, awd, and abs lights went off, the infotainment screen went fully red and rebooted itself, and when it came back I had a chassis stabilization malfunction message. I parked the car and let it sit for a few hours, then when I restarted I had no errors or warnings. I turned the wheel from lock to lock (supposedly how you reset the wheel angle sensor?) and drove around for about an hour of mixed use with no problem.

To me, this sounds like something is either shorting or over-volting. I have heard of people needing to replace the high voltage regulator in the E9X. It's also worth mentioning that I had an oil filter leak a couple months ago which potentially sprayed some oil onto the alternator.

Any suggestions for the best course of action? I do have an ODBII reader which I can use with the Torque Android app - might be able to use this to get some voltage readings?",E90,1576430379,HighlandValley,0,1,True,2019-12-15

E92 335i N54 Serpentine Belt replacement bypassing the AC Compressor pulley.,"This is my first Reddit post, hope this helps though!

When my AC compressor failed in my car the accessory belt failed along with it. Till I could replace the AC compressor I could not drive the car as the accessory belt was torn. I wanted to drive the car until I could get the compressor and change it. I checked forums for my car, and I could not find the exact length of the belt as now the compressor pulley is no more, therefore the belt needs to be shorter than the manufactures recommended length. I checked all over the internet, but I did not find any information regarding the belt. Therefore, I had to measure the length needed by sending a string around the pulleys in a new route and measuring the length of the string.

I'm posting the size of the belt that worked for me and the new belt layout I came up with. I ran the car with this belt for more than a month with no problems whatsoever, I did not baby it btw. 

Serpentine Belt that works for the new layout - Gates 7PK1440 (1440 is the length of the belt in mm, 56.7 inches. 7 is the number of ribs on the belt. Any belt that matches these specs should theoretically work.) The factory belt is 73 inches in length, the shorter belt is used as we are bypassing two of the pulleys. 

Attached is the new belt layout. The AC pulley and the lower idler pulley is bypassed as shown.

My question is regarding the ""Peak Horsepower"" and ""Peak Torque"" figures. If we treat the factory power ratings (300 HP, 300 Torque) as ""peak"", that these numbers would seem to indicate that Dinan is providing +61 Horsepower and +79 torque over stock. However, neither the Max HP Gain or Max Torque Gain come close to these figures. If we use them as reference, the peak horsepower should be 333 and the peak torque should be 354.

Bought a 2005 E90. Need some opinions on upgrade options,"So I bought a 02/2005 318i E90 (pre LCI) from a family member. Long story short it's in near perfect state on mechanics (German ""Scheckheft"" every entry from BMW official, ""fresh TÜV""), but lacks like every extra you could have ordered. As I want to invest into driving it for the next ~5 years, I want to kindly ask you guys for opinions on the following terms:


- The steering wheel is worn out and lacks media buttons.
  - Refurbish it? (Will I probably fuck it up without proper experience?)
  - Replace with identical (Looks like those are hard to find in good shape. Will the airbag be fine?)
  - Replace with one having media buttons? (Looks like I'd have quite extra expenses to get it to work)


- Stereo is ""BMW Business"", and sounds pretty bad. I want an upgrade. Yet it's rather important to me to not break with the interior design, so whatever gets in must fit well or be hidden completely.
   - Get one of those Android 10' display kits from Ebay? What are the hidden problems? 
   - Just replace the loudspeakers? Any recommendation?
   - Get that Android Radio, and also new speakers? Even a power amp? (please recommend me your setup)


- The headlights aren't Xenon
   - Will those ""extra white"" H7's the worth it at all?
   - Any sane options for angel eyes?
   - Replacement headlights worth it?

Do you really have to use BMW brand oil?,"My manual says only have your oil changed at bmw dealership. Every time I've had my oil changed I have taken it to the dealer because I needed to have a recall done anyways.

"First car! 2006 BMW 325xi 6MT, help with some body and wheel damage.","[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/bGcdyr4)

I recently bought this new to me BMW with 125k miles, 0 accidents and a really nice maintenance record. Though I still have to do lower control arms and the oil filter housing gasket. 

It has this minor body damage and quite a bit of curb rash on the wheels, I am a broke teenager so I don’t really have a huge budget to fix this stuff but if I can do something about it for about $100 then I would really appreciate any suggestions. 

I was thinking about getting a paint correction kit and try and fix the scratches on the rear bumper.

I was gonna try and find the paint color for the rims and fill in the worst of the curb rash with filling primer and then match the paint.

Is this too far fetched for a budget of about $100ish, it can stretch a bit but I would rather not.

Best way to confirm a leaky valve cover gasket?,"...short of just taking the damn thing off, that is.

2011 335xi with 55k miles. Getting codes for low intake manifold pressure and the crankcase pressure is far too low - taking the oil fill cap off at idle sounds like I'm opening a can of Coke. Also have had somewhat bad fuel economy - barely in the 20s on a recent long highway trip despite taking it easy.

Doesn't seem like the PCV valve is bad - the barb doesn't suck smoke in or impact idle when blocked. The car also hasn't gone through oil as far as I can tell (e-dipstick level read ""max"" through entire last 5k mile interval). October manufacture date so in theory I shouldn't have the faulty main seals that many N55s had.

Are the symptoms above clearly indicative of the valve cover gasket or is there more I can do to confirm?

If I do replace the gasket, is there anything else I should do while I have it taken apart? Spark plugs, coils, the whole valve cover itself?",E90,1566740153,HighlandValley,18,2,True,2019-08-25
E91 welcoming me to a new noise,"[https://vimeo.com/355975112](https://vimeo.com/355975112)

I have an E91 2007 at 129k miles. A little while back the blower motor stopped working and with significant help from google and youtube I managed to pull the motor out and with a bit of WD40 make the seized motor start to spin freely. I have had to do this around 5 times but saw it as preferential to replacing with a new motor -- until now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only when it is hot outside (a rarity in the UK but currently happens in the afternoon start up) the blower sounds like it is trying to engage warp drive but fails.

Check Engine/Buy a Helicopter Light,"Hello,

I recently replaced a broken charge pipe, which was causing my 335xi to have the warning light on.  I had BMW check out the car, which led to learning the pipe was broken.  After replacing the pipe (with an upgrade to aluminum from OEM plastic) the CEL is still coming on.  It's only been about 20 miles.

&amp;#x200B;

My question: I once drove around without the gas cap tightened and the CEL stayed on for like two weeks because that's how BMW diagnostics roll.  The dealership assured me it was fine and they were correct.  Could this be the same issue as it's also a light from pressure, or should I take it back for more diagnostics?  I'm leaning toward waiting a week or so, but it would be nice to have that damned light stop coming on every 2 miles...

&amp;#x200B;

Also, replacing the broken charge pipe led to an immediate increase in power, but I'm not sure if she has the power she used to have or not because it's been so long with no power at all anyway.

Buying Advice: M47 vs Fixed N47,"Hello, for the past three months I have been looking at the used cars market. I am looking for either a 120d with a M47 or a 118d with a fixed N47. I know these share the same engines with the e90, so I thought this subreddit would be a good place to try and get some advice. 
In the past week, I found a 118d with all the extras that I want and the owner says that the original timing chain and tensioners were replaced. Question 1: Is this engine now reliable, or should I still be worried about the same issue?
I actually prefer an older 120d with the M47, because of the extra power, but these are rarer than the newer 118d. Question 2: If I get a 120d with the M47 engine, should I blank the swirl flaps right away or can I trust it for a little while? The cars I am looking for have around 200 000 KM. Question 3: How common do you think are engine problems caused by the swirl flaps issue?

Question 4: I have heard in a YT video that the cars with the N47 engine are not as well made as the previous generation, because BMW had to cut some corners due to financial issues.

But then I checked craigslist and found a 2006 330i with 90k on it for $6500. It’s clearly been babied and has all service history/records/receipts.

Oil and filter change 200 miles ago, new oil filter housing gasket, new Valvetronic sensor shaft, new brakes, pads and fluids, New ignition coils, spark plugs, all that good stuff.  Premium package and Cold Weather Package.

- Valve Cover Gasket 
- Oil Filter and Oil Cooler Gaskets
- Oil Pan Gasket
- Walnut blasted regularily
- New Plugs and Coils
- New Battery
- New tie rods and wheel bearings
- Oil changes done every 3000kms
- Every single recall has been done (hpfp, etc...)

Low Boost -- STILL,"Hello Everyone,

Background: 2010 335xi coupe, 114,500 miles.

Hoping someone can give me an idea.  My engine light is now in month 6 of coming on constantly, and it's annoying.  It's half filled, and the code is ""low boost.""  I brought it to my mechanic and he replaced some hoses , which fixed it for like a week, then it came back on after I heard a ""SNAP.""  I brought it to BMW, they said the charge pipe was cracked (it was) and I replaced that with an aluminum aftermarket pipe.  They also fixed a broken canister (whatever that is) and deemed it repaired.  

After that the car got a ton of its missing power back, but the light still comes on.  Did a smoke test, found a small leak in a hose which was fixed, but now it's STILL coming on.  I guess the next step is a pressure test, but I'm getting fed up with that light and I'm not sure where else it could be.  

Has anyone had similar problems?  There's not smoke leaking out at this point, but before I pay for the pressure test I'm hoping I can identify if there's another issue.

OBD2 Real time data - Should it show fuel pressure?,"Hey Guys, 

I am trying to narrow down a fuel pressure issue that I have. The only diagnostics kit I have on me right now is a cheap bluetooth obd scanner and my phone with ""torque"" app. Within torque I can see the fuel rail PSI (which is after the hpfp iirc) but the app cannot see standard fuel pressure. Which I believe is the low pressure pump side of things. Do you know if I should be able to read it? or if any of you can read it using this app? As that would indicate that the sensor is knackered. Or is the fuel pressure simply not relayed through simple OBD2? and I would need better diag software? 

If any of you know, or could test this quickly with your car and let me know that would be awesome!

"SOS Malfunction, No sound, door chimes etc E92 335i","Hello,

I've recently purchased a 2008 335i and it has no audio as the usual SOS Malfunction issue causes.

There are a plethora of threads about this, I've looked through as many as I could with the time I have but all end up with using a MOST bypass loop before the Sat Radio which yields wanted results.

In my case I have exhausted all options I am aware of. Amp has yellow blinking LED which means functional but something in the loop is not. Bluetooth Module has the red optical light on connector, and once connected the harness for the Sat Radio blinks red as well.

&amp;#x200B;

With the sat radio plugged in, there is no red optical light at the final MOST termination under the steering wheel (under the dash by footwell). Unplugged the connector and attached the MOST bypass loop and it is still the same result, no red light on the final MOST termination.

&amp;#x200B;

I unplugged the AMP connector and attached the MOST bypass loop to it, to make sure its not just the loop that is broken on arrival, but I have red optical lights on all connectors after the amp, with the final termination as the exception.

I am completely out of ideas, I've removed the driverside rear bolster to uncover the MOST BUS, but all i see is a bunch of terminations and really nothing out of the ordinary. Definitely nothing tampered underneath there by anyone's hands.

How difficult is it to drive 320d (2007-11) on snow?,"So I want to buy 320d manual transmission, I'm a new driver (2 years) and have never driven a rear-wheel drive car before.

Whoever I told that I want to get BMW 320d (from 2007 to maybe 2011) has called me crazy and said it's really difficult to drive on snow for a new driver like me.

Snowy winters here last from maybe late December to late February (but I'm probably exaggerating), and it happens that streets are not clean for first couple of days when it snows, sometimes more.

My question is, are these people exaggerating? I even mentioned ESP and they shrugged it off as it's a relatively old model, and the system was not as good back then.

AHL function in aftermarket non-AHL,"Hello,

I have an e92 328i with the adaptive xenons which work perfectly, however the wiring is degrading and none of the halos work. They’re a mess so I’m trying to figure out a way to get back halos while maintaining the adaptive features. 

I’ve thought about shelling out the cash and just getting new adaptive headlights. While this is expensive, it’s a full proof plan. I’d like to find a way around this if possible, one idea I had was to take aftermarket non-ahl headlights and retrofit the adaptive feature from the stock headlights. 

Does anyone know if this would be possible or what kind of roadblocks I’d be hitting? I have no issues fabricating something if need be, but there’s no sense of doing that if the cost will be roughly the same as a new pair of stock headlights.

Does anyone regard this as a real and pressing issue? In the EU more and more countries are planning to phase out diesel cars bellow EURO6 in the near future and I feel that EURO4 petrol cars might be next on the list.

No matter how tight I pull the handle, I never get anymore hold. Is this a symptom of a stretched cable? I noticed when I had the rotors off that the cable extended pretty far out and looked like it had a lot of slack.

Each one was formated in FAT32. I even tried NTFS and FAT, with different cluster size, formated both in Windows and many Linux distributions, both trough terminal or GUI, or 3rd party programs like 'Mini tool partition wizard' etc. (was trying it for hours with laptop in my lap, in a car).

Ticking noise when getting rolling,"Hey everyone, 

I’ve noticed that I have a distinct ticking noise that sounds like it’s coming from right under me when I get going in 1st and 2nd gear.

The sound goes away when I have the clutch fully depressed, or once I get past 2000rpm in second.

The ticking speeds up as I accelerate, and I can sometimes hear it when I’m slowing down as well. It’s just enough to piss me off knowing that something is wrong.

High miler and a DPF,"For ages I've had a niggle with my 330d, it regenerates too often - around 125 miles, it has been as low as 75 miles at times.

Looking for help in troubleshooting 30FF (boost under target) only when jb4 is enabled with anti rattle algorithm,"I realize that this might be a long shot in asking this sub and not just going to the n54tech forums first but I would like to see if anyone here has any ideas.

I have 2009 335i. Pretty much stock except for the jb4, which I have been running map 1 for the past ~4 years. I have the waste gate rattle and use the jb4's ""alternative anti-rattle algorithm"", which has been pretty good for the past 9 months or so since I was hit with the rattle.

Last Friday night, I started to consistently get 30FF codes under normal acceleration. In the past, there's been times where I would get a 30FF every once in awhile, but now I'm getting them all the time. No work has been done recently that could be the direct cause of this issue. 

I started troubleshooting by following [this DIY](https://www.n54tech.com/forums/showthread.php?t=13114), but didn't get too far due to not having some of the necessary tools, but I don't think it matters anymore because I think I have narrowed it down to an issue caused by certain jb4 configs. 

&amp;nbsp;

** **
**Initial Troubleshooting** 

First off, let me just say that I know 30FF can be caused by a lot of things. I went straight to checking vac lines but I do not think it's a vac leak (new vac lines everywhere except haven't gotten solenoid to front actuator yet). I pull 26 inches of mercury at idle and I checked pressure at the following locations and everything seemed good to me:

* just before the solenoids (read vacuum just after the vacuum canisters) (result: no leak before solenoids), 
* after individual solenoids leading to waste gate actuators (clamped lines to check individual lines leading to solenoids (no apparent leaks there)), 
* and with both solenoids connected (vacuum hose tee for line connecting solenoids) (nothing out of the ordinary)
* I did the above steps while adjusting the default waste gate position with the jb4 (set to 0, 20, 60, 100) and the vacuum adjusted accordingly and I could also see the rear actuator move. 

that's about as far as I could get following that n54tech DIY so far. I tried finding a syringe to connect to the line leading to the actuators to pull vacuum manually to verify they were holding vacuum (easier to hold the syringe plunger over time == leak), but I can't find a store that sells those fuckers (been everywhere).

&amp;nbsp;

** ** 
**jb4 causing the problem?**

This morning I realized that I forgot to check with jb4 disabled (I've become so used to just always having it on that it slipped my mind). Here are the different configurations I had tested:

* I set jb4 to map 0 but didn't disable anti-rattle algorithm (it appeared that anti-rattle algorithm was still in effect even though I was on map 0 (watching default waste gate position on app)). On map 0, boost was meeting target (~9.5psi), no 30FF codes thrown. 

* On map 0 without anti-rattle algorithm (it was painful to have to listen to that rattle): No codes thrown, boost was meeting target

* map 1, no anti-rattle algorithm: no codes thrown, boost was meeting target under normal acceleration and under WOT (~13.5 psi).

* map 1, anti-rattle enabled: I get a 30FF. I'm getting about half the boost that is targeted. Also, it's very evident by exhaust note that something isn't right (don't know how to describe it - sounds grunty or something - not in a good way). 

&amp;nbsp;

Here's a quick table for easier reading:

&amp;nbsp;





jb4 Map | Anti-rattle disabled | Anti-rattle enabled
---|---|----
**map 0** | no codes, boost meets target | no codes, boost meets target 
**map 1** | no codes, boost meets target  | **30FF**



The question is why does Map 1 with anti-rattle cause 30FF while Map 0 (also with anti-rattle enabled) does not cause 30FF? 

Why does Map 1 with anti-rattle disabled fix my problem?

Help! I accidentally cleared faults before repairing.,"Backstory: I have a 2007 328i and it was recently rear-ended. The body shop did repairs and replaced backup sensors. during the repair, I was told the battery and alternator went bad at the same time. I decided to replace them myself. When the work was done and after jumping the car from the mechanic, I noticed the power steering was out, along with a host of faults (including a red steering wheel and ABS warning) but I assumed this was due to the electrical issues with the alt and batt. I replaced the alt and batt and the ""service engine soon"" light went away. 

The mistake: Using a Bluetooth OBD2 scanner and app, I checked for faults on the car. All the codes that came up were associated with the steering, so without thinking or possibly out of habit, I cleared the faults. I immediately regretted doing it and of course, when I pulled out of the driveway, the power steering was still out. Is there any way I can get those codes back to show my mechanic, and/or will the coffee come back if the ""service engine soon"" light is gone? I read on the forums that I probably just needed to reset the steering and register the new battery through the OBD2, but Im worried I have I created a situation where I cannot fix the steering without the fault logged.

Worth upgrading from 325xi sedan to 335xi Coupe?,"Hey guys, 

I currently own a 2006 325xi sedan. Owned it since it was brand new, it was originally my moms and I got the car handed down to me this year. It only has 97,500kms (60,500 miles) and my mom would only service the car at the dealer so it has about $12k in work done on it (which is insane considering how low the clicks are on it).

Anyways, I came across an ad of someone selling their 1 owner, lady driven 2008 335xi coupe with only 91,000kms (~56,500 miles) on it with a clean car report and it too was only serviced at the dealer. My friends have 335s and I have heard many great things about the N54 engine. The price they are asking is very good and it may come down to only a $1000 upgrade if I'm lucky and able to sell my car at the right price. I've never bought a used car before but have always wanted an E92 and am mostly concerned about reliability of the N54 as my friends sometimes have lots of issues with warning lights popping up (but they also have tuned theirs). Is it worth upgrading from a E90 325xi to a E92 335xi? Will I be putting a lot of money into the car considering the low mileage?

so my issue is that i have a 2010 328i sedan basic car with the sports package (135,xxxmi). a few months ago when i had a oil change at the dealership i was informed that i had to replace my oil filter housing gasket, oil pan gasket, rear differential cover gasket, and valve cover gasket. dealer quoted me about 4k for that. anyways yesterday when idling it started to make a whining noise from the engine bay, i turned off the ac and the noise went away. so i figure its either has something to do with the belt or the ac compressor. with all that being said i should probably change the water pump and thermostat as well. so here is the rub i have about 4k that i can drop on this car right now, should i go to a reputable local bmw shop instead of a dealership?(should be cheaper i would think)  or do i just get rid of it and start all over with a new car and start having monthly payments again?

 for the most part car has been fine, road noise is a little more noticeable than when i first got it but that should be normal. anyways thanks for the input.",E90,1563059813,MFdaft,13,2,True,2019-07-13

You can see in pictures where smoke is coming out, there is no light or any sensor warning me of something. Car was serviced from where I bought it 2 months ago. 

I have no clue about cars, but what do you think I can expect when I drive it to mechanic? :S Thank you all.

I have circled on first image from which area I think smoke is coming:

P0133 O2 slow circuit response AGAIN!!,"A little backstory on what's happened so far... I had a JB4 with catless downpipe, catless exhaust, and intake and decided I wanted a change so I had a friend with tuning software write a stage 2 tune on the DME and I removed the JB4. For the first few days the car ran great, I had the extra power and it was a thrill. Soon after, I received a P0133 fault which is 02 sensor slow circuit response on bank 1 sensor 1. 

I cleared the code and continued on. It came back. So I had my friend flash the DME back to stock and ran the car again for a few days. The code came back again. Next, I had the mechanic replace the O2 sensor on Bank 1 Sensor 1. At this point, the car does not have the JB4 or a DME flash tune however I just received the CEL for the same fault. 

Also, I had my muffler shop remove the secondary cats a few days ago and they did not mentioned any leaks in the exhaust. When car is idling with the hood up, I also do not hear any hissing or leaking sounds on the intake. Just not sure where to go next.

E90 320d (2005) running kinda rough,"Hello everyone ! 2nd post here.

As the title says I have the 320d (2005). The cars feels a bit sluggish all of a sudden. In 2nd gear it just doesn't have the same feeling as it did before (poor acceleration) it just doesn't have the same power as before. On top of that the engine just feels more shakey especially at iddle. The car just feels heavier to say so. And the sound of it, I don't know how to explain but it just doesn't sound right to me. The other problem i have is when I suddenly left the foot off the gas the car shakes a little (it feels like the back of it) ... The same is when i lift the foot off the gas and  quickly press the clutch. 

The oil and the filters are almost 1 year old now , but I don't think this is the issue. What do you guys think ?

VANOS Failure - Pulling hair out," VANOS Solenoids have failed me before - I knew there was a problem with them. I would normally have to restart the car on the side of the road to restore power. Did this on a trip back from NC.  


Recently, VANOS failed on Highway while boosting. Went Limp mode. Restarted car. This time had significant power loss, outside of limp mode.  


VANOS solenoids replaced. Codes have not come back.  


From 1000-3000 (Before turbos kick in) there is a significant lack of power. I have to push the pedal down a decent amount to notice acceleration.   


I had someone plug ODB in and drive the car. They noticed a fuel pressure problem.  


I have smelled fuel twice leaving 1st gear today.  


Could it be the VANOS system itself? I hear symptoms are similar to what I'm describing, bad MPG, lower power in lower range RPM..

E90 320d 2009 - Help with Electric Power Steering (EPS),"Hi all. Regretfully I damaged my steering rack, specifically the EPS control unit, and have been facing misery over the last 3 weeks trying to get my power steering working again.

My understanding is after replacing the steering rack you need to code the unit. I was hoping to get some more specifics on how to do this for an E Series vehicle with the diagnostic software - I've been struggling to find much information on this since info is more abundant for F cars. I'm still very new to the BMW tools but from what I understand, you have to get the unit's ZUSB/ZB number from the Ident or UIF section under the Functional Jobs in INPA, then put it in WinKFP and try to program your car's VIN to the EPS unit.

- Is the procedure as I described correct? I would be very grateful for more of a granular step-by-step.
- My major gripe is I have connected two other steering rack motors so far and I haven't been able to see the EPS module (I believe it shows as ""D_EPS"") in INPA. This is why I'm wondering if I'm running off an assumption that this section of INPA will even show the module before it's programmed and if I'm going about this wrong way. From what I've read I don't think there's another way to get the ZUSB without going through Identification in INPA or Tool32. I've also tried to go directly into the Electric Power Steering section under Chassis but it says there's no response from the control unit with both racks.

For what it's worth, I've fetched the E89 SP-daten files from BimmerGeeks and imported them with the BMW Coding Tool program.

I am pondering the possibility of the connections or fuses for the power steering system being damaged. One of the cables took very minor damage (small piercing through plastic with one or two severed copper strands poking out, all electric-taped up now) but I don't think it's the problem. I think there could be a connection or grounding point I might be missing - I've been focused on the 3 cables running to the control unit. My friend took every fuse out the glove compartment fuse box and inspected them for blow signs - he also said there was no fuse inside for numbers 05, 49, and 75 but this is probably because I have the wrong fuse table since this is _also_ an area I've struggled to find solid info on due to car variations etc... I think there might also be a fuse for the EPS inside the red rear power distribution panel but I'll need to do more research on opening it up to get at the fuses. I might take my multimeter to the three connectors for the rack and see if I can observe anything.

Any direction on this conundrum would be deeply appreciated - it's been a bit of a depressing struggle so far for a fresh DIY mechanic, and the train to work doesn't help! I gather I'll need to code it anyway even if any physical connection issue is fixed so it would be great to get more specific info out there for fellow E9X owners :) Hopefully I'll be able to sort this and other niggles out myself with persistence and some elbow grease and save up for the eventual reluctant indie visit (I've yet to try one out near me).

About to trade this thing in....,"I have a BMW 335i.. It was prestine, until recently.

I was on the highway passing someone, and I got half engine light, limp mode.

Took it to advance to read the code, VANOS Solenoids. No big deal right? Restarted the car, half of the power was just missing, even though limp mode was gone. Thought I destroyed the timing or something serious, knew it was something serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Took it to a shop, they changed the solenoids. No more codes. Didn't listen to me about the power missing. Sent me on my way. Told me I needed a water pump.

&amp;#x200B;

So then I start smelling fuel here and there, car just isn't the same at all.

I take it back to them, tell them to just do the water pump. Change the plugs, change a coil on the one cylinder that popped up a code a few months ago.

I said the problem is still there. They recommend shotgunning a fuel pressure regulator at it.

Did that. No difference.

Car is missing pressure. I only have 2AAF General Fuel pressure plausibility.

Thought I smelled fuel out of the oil cap.

Power is just different, car went from feeling extremely responsive, torqued quick, to sluggish under low RPMS. Essentially if it felt anything similar to a hybrid when you pushed the gas, it now feels like it's 40 years old.

It still drives.

Took it somewhere else, they basically think I'm crazy.

&amp;#x200B;

Car jumps in idle, shakes near tail end.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm done. I don't know what to do. No one listens to me. Tell me the car drives fine. I know whatever issue I'm having, is going to blow my pistons, or cause my turbos to explode. There's a pressure loss of some kind.

Considering tire options -would like feedback,"I have been considering tire options but would like some feedback on what tires some people run. 

I have a base model 2007 328i. I currently have run flat tires on it and was debating going to a more normal tire. I wasn't sure however if there is much of a noticeable difference in handling. 

I am also trying to figure out if I should just go with all seasons or hold off for a bit and get winter tires. I do have a set of z4 wheels that I put on for autocross that has some 200 treadwear tires on them, but by the time next season rolls around I may need to replace those. I could just replace them with summer tires. I don't think I am good enough to make a difference in times between summer and autocross tires. Then i wouldn't have to change wheels for events. 

My other option would be to put either run flats or standard all season tires on it now and then replace my 200 treadwear tires whenever they wear enough. 

I really have only ahd a flat tires a few times in my years of driving and usually can get the tire pumped up long enough to get to a shop.

What are my dad's options for bluetooth music streaming/radios?,"Dad just got a 2006 323i. I started doing some reading but wanted clarification on our options on getting bluetooth for phone calls, music all while using steering wheel controls

I went to bimmer.work . Here are the last 7 digits of his VIN: KW29368

We'd prefer to keep everything as original as possible. So I see some people are using Tune2Air in their cars. We only have an AUX jack in the center arm rest. So after some reading it seems like he would need a WMA3000B?

Since his car doesn't have bluetooth to answer calls. How would we achieve that? Can an OEM bluetooth module be added?

We could potentially install his old Clarion CZ702 with a single DIN faceplate &amp; harness. How would he retain steering wheel controls?

Steering wheel shaking after breaking from highway speeds (2011 328i with xDrive),"Hi Everyone.

Last fall i was experiencing a shaky steering wheel when breaking at around 100km/h. 

I replaced my breaks and rotors and the issue went away. A few weeks later it started happening again. After taking it back to my mechanic, he said that the driver side rotor was slightly warped/bent and that was causing the issue. He RMA'd the part and again the problem went away. 


Now it's spring time and i'm noticing the shaking again!

Is it really just a really bad off-brand rotor that he's using? Or is there some other problem that's damaging my rotor.


is there any recommendation on a particular brand i should use? 
Any thing else i should be looking for?

$2200 E92 335xi feels like I stole it,"I've had my E90 since 2015 and its FBO, MHD and Xdelete.  3 weeks ago, I bought the E92 for $2200.

Spent $250 on a key from a mobile locksmith then used my stock parts from the E90 with a new radiator, water pump, valve cover and OFH gaskets and she's running great.  

Icing on the cake was when I went to the junkyard a week after and found an Active AutoWerks catback and downpipes for $37 dollars. (Charged me for 2 mufflers at 9.95 each and 10 feet of piping at 1.50 per foot then I sold the downpipes for $160 LOL)

Question about the 2011 328i's reliability from a college student,"Hello /r/e90!

I am a 19 year old college student and have been strongly considering the 2011 bmw 328i rwd for a new car. I've tried to do as much research as possible on the car, however I still have one question that only you guys would probably answer best. 

How reliable is the car? I understand the expensive maintenance and repairs, possibility of electronics breaking &amp; oil leaks and such, but how reliable is the car with that age if it's driven heavily? 

To be honest, my driving style is really not.. too reserved. I enjoy to accelerate heavily whenever I can, I speed, I enjoyed doing donuts  in my current AWD car the past winters, ect. How would a 2011 328i hold out to this? I heard the engine is strong, but could I expect it being heavily damaged? I most likely won't be able to find the right car with a manual, how dependable is the 6 speed automatic transmission?

If I find a 2011 328i with 50~60k miles or so, how long could I expect to keep the car assuming I do extensive maintenance however drive like an ape on the road? Any insights would be appreciated. Thank you so much!",E90,1557559433,dagreshaosu,11,3,True,2019-05-11

For people who own or owned an 320i or 325i, what's your experience with them in term of fuel consumption? If you could go into details that would be appreciated. Any piece of information would be really helpful.

Thank you!",E90,1558455712,Tobbyi,6,2,True,2019-05-21
Tried to install android head unit and now my old radio doesn’t work anymore,"I have a 2011 E90 without Idrive not logic 7.

I am installed an android head unit. The new unit came with an adapter for the radio harness. I put the adapter on the harness and it was a very tight fit. When I connected everything the head Unit wouldn’t turn on. I wanted to see if there was an issue with the head unit so I decided to test if it’s the unit’s problem by going back to my old radio.

The adapter and harness was really hard to pull off and I really had to pull hard. When I try to plug in my old radio the old radio will not turn on anymore. On the harness there is a red blinking from the thick black wire.

Could there be an issue with my radio harness? I checked both the fuse box for the radio on the radio and car and both are fine.",E90,1558458548,jcbayarea,1,3,True,2019-05-21
Vibration when braking,"Howdy all,

I have been chasing a problem and finally decided to ask for help. First, backstory. My car had a vibration in the steering wheel when braking, mostly around the 20-30 mph range under moderate braking. I assumed that it was warped rotors. So I replaced rotors and pads.

Fast forward to after that repair. I now have a similar vibration under moderate braking when the speed is between 30-45 mph. If I lightly or aggressively brake through this range I feel nothing. If I brake from 30 to 0 there is no vibration and if I brake from 70 to 40 there is no vibration.

Intermittant miss - no code,"I have had an intermittant miss on my 07 328. The miss typically does not happen when it is cold, only when warm and only at idle as far as I have noticed. 

A couple of months ago I had a miss that tripped a code for #6 cylinder misfire. I changed the coil and i thought it went away. 

It has been missing again but I have not gotten a code to come up yet. Therw is a lot of troubleshooting regarding switching things out and see if it follows it but without a code to follow that makes it more difficult. 

I changed the spark plugs either last summer or early last fall. I have changed the exhaust side VANOS solenoid that had tripped a code and that improved it a bit I thought. 

I am torn on where to go next without just throwing money at it. The car has more than 150k miles and i have had it for 30k miles or so and am not sure what is still original to the car that may need replaced as a wear/normal maintenance item. 

I do have a code for the the thermostat. I do have a thermostat and need to get that changed out soon. I wouldn't think the ecm reading the temp wrong would only cause issues at idle when warm.

320i rough idle,"Hello,

I was looking at a friend's 320i E92 today. The idle is slightly rough and every now and then the revs drop, it struggles for a split second, then recovers. Apparently it can feel a little lethargic pulling off too.

Google was suggesting a vacuum leak, but I was struggling to find any vacuum lines. Is everything electric on that engine now? I disconnected the MAF to see if it ran any better - it didn't. So the MAF is OK. Also, my theory is this would also eliminate a vacuum leak? Vacuum leaks are a problem because extra air is entering the intake manifold after the sensor, but if the sensor is disconnected, it shouldn't matter how the air is entering the engine?

Spark plugs were replaced recently and the air filter looked almost new.

Excited about my new-to-me e90 but also a rant,"I just picked a 2010 328i 4 door RWD 6 speed, and I'm super excited as I've been driving a Honda for the past 3 yrs and the boringness was starting to drive me insane. When I test drove the BMW first thing I noticed was the heavy steering and it instantly brought back the feeling of driving a normal car again. 

Don't get wrong, the Honda served its purpose but I am really looking forward to enjoying my commute(s) a lot more with a car more focused on that experience.

That being said though, I can't help but feel annoyed at some options that really should come standard on this car (IMO), so I just wanted to get these off my chest real quick.. feel free to throw your 2 cents in. Note that my criteria was a 4 door 09-11 328i no xdrive, manual, any interior/color except tan - and there were like 2 to choose from with 100 miles, so I couldn't really narrow it down even further and be picky with options.

*  comfort access not standard - come on! my friend's base model 06 lexus is 250 had this for like four years now and BMW makes you pay extra until 2011?? If I have to put the key in anyways then I might as well turn it to start the car

* seats - the sport package ones are sexy but regular ones looks a little basic, even when compared to my Honda and especially the (much older) Lexus which had vented seats standard for like 5+ years before it was even an option on the 3 series

I am very happy with my purchase and prefer it over its competitors, just slightly bitter I couldn't find one with those ones ordered.

Oh and the dong drives me crazy. Why is it donging as soon as the car is started? It's a normal thing to happen.  I'm just sitting here, I didn't do anything wrong, there is no danger to warn me about. So yeah I've been reading up on coding thing and it's cool to have that available.

2009 335i xDrive Cylinder 3 Misfire," So I have a 335xi and I knew that I was leaking a lot of oil onto the top of my engine around my coils. I was driving to work and the check engine light came on, a very rough idle and that roughness would continue until I reached maybe 25mph then it would smooth out also cruise control seemed to override my lack in power. A friend at work used some app on his phone to scan the codes for me and we got P311B and P0136 the latter is a code for an 02 sensor but the former, I only found 1 website with that code and it was in french but It was kind of easy to see that it was cylinder 3 on this website. So I pulled ignition coil 3 while the car was on and the car did not drop in idle which has me thinking its either the coil the spark plug or something worse. I did clean a lot of oil off the top of my engine when I got home from work, and most of my spark plugs were sitting in oil as well that I had to clean out with a paper towel. Last night I switched ignition coil 2 and 3 to see if the misfire would follow the coil sadly it didn't. I know my valve cover is leaking but I don't think that could be causing my misfire. Also a note about how much oil I've been leaking its cover my rear bumper and license plate as well as my exhaust under the car.

Clutch bloeding... blew up my slave,"So last night I was nearing the end of my second clutch replacement.

This time, I knew I needed the level high. I was still having a hell of a time bleeding it with help checking the level and actuating the pedal. I opted to remove the slave cylinder to bleed. I was able to bleed it. I put the Slave back in, go to cycle any air that might still be in there, and POP. Slave cylinder blew and brake fluid starts draining from the bell housing. 

I realize now the slave cylinder actuator missed the clutch fork. 

I have a spare slave, and this time I’m going to use the oil can reverse bleed method. How ever, I’m worried about getting the slave cylinder on the fork with the transmission in the car.

oil consumption,"Hi r/E90,

&amp;#x200B;

I got my car in Xmas time and it's asking for another quart of oil, this will be my third one since Xmas. I'm thinking that I may have a leak at this point, but I drive like an asshole (not really)  and shift between 3-4k RPM from 1-2-3 and sometimes higher, and also lower. 

&amp;#x200B;

I do wait for oil to reach temperature before driving like this, but I'm thinking it may be possible, since I'm in the mid range, that I'm just running the car hotter and burning more oil.  Does this logic have any merit?

My Baby Car,"&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 8e9o245muz331...*

  
Hello all,  
I would like to give you a little story about my baby car. This is the car I have dreamt for a long time. The car is BMW E90 LCI with some M-Pack accessories. I was so happy when I bought the car. My friends and I were so on the top, we were a lot of our time in the car, around it and we were really happy.

Unfortunately the engine somehow has some little little holes in the lower inside part near and on the cylinders. So the engine needs replacement.

I started to save a little money but it is not enough. So I came here to seek help and donations, because I don't have the needed money to fix her right away. I know a stranger asking for this kind of stuff is sketchy, but it is true story. If you know what it is to be unable to drive your true love and your dream car, please donate a $1 to my cause.

The max amount I need to receive is $2000, which basically means 2000 people. I think it is possible.

My main concern is reliability and I want the car to last, so just wanted to ask if it's safe for the engine to just floor it sometimes when driving on the back roads and have some fun in general. So the question is if this engine was created for this and will handle everything with no issues or it's just capable of giving you nice acceleration but you'll pay the price down the road( fixing engine oil leaks and all that stuff).

Cold start issues,"I have a 06 325i production mo. 05/05 with some recent starting issues..

After sitting for 7+ hours, my engine will crank sometimes until it shuts off itself from cranking for so long. sometime 3 full cycles, which causes the battery to die. After jumping it, it'll crank for a little longer and finally start. Sometimes it'll crank a full cycle and start the next time I push to start.

I normally park in my garage and don't have the Starting issue, but tonight I did. two full cycles of cranking, lights and dash started flickering, and finally it ""caught"" and started before killing the battery. 

Drives perfectly fine and restarts perfect in 1 second. if I start it every 4 hours or so, it'll keep cranking fine, but when I leave it for longer than 7, I have to worry about jumping it from cranking for so long...

I'm trying to narrow down the problem, as I am pretty handy and fairly knowledgeable..

1- (bad battery?) even though advanced auto battery test showed good-needs charged. CCA is rated 850 , mine tested at 725 before being charged. Is it normal for our batteries to die after 3 full starting cycles? it seems I should have more juice than to be dead In this short of time. Carly showed volts at 12 when engine off, drop down to 10-11 during crank, and 14+ when running. 

2- leaking fuel injector when let sit for so long? I've read that once engine cranks, that extra fuel gets burnt up and let's the engine start?

3- fuel pump? I've read bad pumps are rare on n52's? I hear pump prime when I unlock or open the door. No driveability issues.

4- I keep getting random error codes on Carly. ranging from cam sensor, to steering angel sensor, speed sensors, misfires.

Pre-purchase Advice Needed (2008 335xi MT),"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I live in the Northeast of the United States and I have been driving an E46 325ci that other than a few electrical problems (alternator, battery, and starter) has been very good to me.  I am looking to get another car for when I go out to Michigan for college next summer, and it appears that I have found that in an E90 I will be taking a look at in a few weeks.  It is an hour and a half drive away, so I would like to check with you guys to see if it sounds like it's worth it.  I talked to him for a good amount of time on the phone, and he has indicated to me the only reason he is selling the car is due to downsizing, and that he has an E39 M5 that he drives around more.

&amp;#x200B;

The specifications are that the car is a 2008 335xi with a 6-speed MT.  The vehicle has 90k miles on it, and has only been driven about 500 miles in the last year.  It is a one-owner car who has done most of the work himself since 50k miles, with the exception of new dealer-installed turbos about 20k miles ago.  It has had the water pump replaced, as well as new brakes, new Michelin Pilot Sport tires in the back, new spark plugs replaced 30k miles ago, and new Bilstein front coil-over springs and shocks.  This car also has a front clear bra installed.  He insists the car has never been beaten on, and he has never had to install any new clutch in this E90, or his M5.  The man also says he has all records and receipts available.

The price is \~$8100.

Changed my BMW E90's Vibration Damper...,"So I have a BMW E90 that is making squeaky noise. The mechanic suggested I change my vibration damper. The original was too expensive, so I bought a cheap Chinese replacement. It was a bit heavier than the original. Then when it was installed. The sound went back to normal. After around 4 days, there was a squeaky and loud rough noise. Upon having it checked by 2 mechanics, they said it was the belt tensioner. The first mechanic proved it to me by using a wrench and tightening the system. So I bought a tensioner and had it replaced. Now there's another sound. It's very different from the sounds before. I had it checked again and the compressor needs replacing soon. The mechanic told me that I should just wait for it to die, and that the compressor wouldn't affect the engine, only the AC.


I was wondering. Did the heavy vibration damper cause this?

Or did the other parts start dying down because of the tension from the stronger newly replaced vibration damper? ",E90,1553016151,Tirolizard,3,2,True,2019-03-19
Viewing a 335d... things to look out for?,"Hi all,

I'm new to the E9X world... I have owned an E46 323Ci a few years back and now looking to come back to the BMW world again

I've been looking at 330d and 335d models (specifically after a diesel)... I prefer the idea of a 335d but they seem harder to come by, but feel I'll regret it if i get a 330d instead...

I've found two E92 335d that aren't a million miles away and they're actually fairly close to each other so I'm planning to go take a look over the weekend if they're still around.

What things should I be looking out for? Are there any common problems or known issues to check?

If it makes a difference spec wise, I'm in the UK. I know for some models the US and Europe got different specs but I have no idea if that is the case with the E9X.

Also a quick question regarding iDrive... one of the cars I have my eye on has iDrive, one doesn't... I have heard that there is a CCC and a CIC model. The CIC being far more superior but expensive to upgrade to...

So I guess my first question, is iDrive in general worth it? Should I rule out any that don't have it, or is it just a gimmick that I can do without?

If it is worth having, is it possible to retrofit to a non-iDrive car? I notice that the dashboard appears completely different (at least at the top) so I imagine it's a hard job to do, if it's even possible.

Music wise, I mostly listen to CDs or an iPod Classic... bluetooth is nice... and I'm not overly bothered about satnav, so I feel I could do without... but I do like toys... it just seems within my budget, most 335d's don't have iDrive... but most 330d's do

"I need help w/alignment specs: 335is (e92), B12 pro-kit, and M3 front arms... too many choices. Need guidance!","Hello!

Hope you all can help me here. I've got my car in at the dealer. The tech working on my car is super cool and was willing to look up a bunch of different options in their database to use to align the thing tomorrow morning. I don't know which one though! Suspension setup is a dark art and I know very little about it. The tech advised I pose the question to the forums to see what y'all say. 

I appreciate the time taken to read this far!

MY setup:
E93 335is with M3 front control arms and the Eibach/Billstein B12 pro-kit. The front rides significantly lower with the ProKit but the rear didn't change much by comparison. I also have the M3 rear subframe bushings.

In the past a different tech set it up with ""m3 front and 335 rear"" specs but there's way more to it than that. My tech this time looked up specs to ""e92 performance sport suspension SZP5A"", ""e92 sport suspension US ver."", ""e92 M3 Competition Package"", ""e92 M3 (regular one)"", and finally ""e92 low slung sport suspension"".

My goals are for sharp turn in and minimal tire wear. Most of my driving is freeway.

Faulty Actuator Help,"Alright. I have a 2006 330i. The left rear door lock actuator is giving me issues. I’ve done about 5 hours of research and have found a lot of people with similar issues, but none that fit mine exactly.

When I pull the handle on the outside or the inside of the car, the door doesn’t open. When I hit the lock/unlock button on the key fob or the center dash, I can hear and see the lock moving, so that’s not the issue.

1. Some suggested it was a fuse issue with location 57. It had a 15A in it that was kinda dirty but still good, but I replaced it with a 20A anyway and it still didn’t work.

2. Some had issues with the child safety lock, but my car doesn’t have that feature so that can’t be it.

3. I removed the inner door panel and confirmed that when I pull on the outside handle or pull on the lever that would be connected to the inner handle, the cable compresses but nothing further happens. I tried forcing the bracket down to “completion” in the same direction the cable tries to compress it and that also did nothing.

I can’t remove or replace the actuator because 2/3 of the torque screws holding it in place are on the back of the door, which I can’t access because it doesn’t open. I assume the actuator is completely ceased, but most other folks seems to be able to bypass that by compressing the bracket connected to the cable mentioned earlier.

I’ve had the car for about 4 years now and this is the first issue I just can’t seem to figure out so I’d really appreciate any help or suggestions!

Also, I cannot stand my local BMW dealership so taking it to them is not an option. Awful people.

Suspension woes,"Hey guys,

Wondering if anyone might have some insight into a problem I’m having. I purchased an E90 328i about two and a half months ago. A couple weeks into my ownership, I started hearing a clunking sound coming from the right rear of the car. At first it sounded like something flying around in the trunk but after removing everything, including the paneling, tools, etc, I kept hearing it. Jack it up and take of the wheel and the shock is clearly blown out. Leaking oil and flapping around. I ordered two rear shocks and a shock mounting kit from FCP Euro and replace both rear shocks. Test drive is great, nice and solid. A week or so later, the noise gradually returns until I can tell that the left rear shock is now completely blown. The feel at the rear of the car is super loose and running over bumps / uneven surfaces makes the clunking sound just like before. 

Now, maybe I just got unlucky with the parts, but it’s got me thinking that the blown shocks are a symptom of something else. What could they even be, if possibly related? Any suggestions on what I should be looking at?

PS I haven’t yet jacked the rear up and confirmed this, but the sound, handling and everything else matches the symptoms I previously had when it was definitely a blown shock.

Advice for E90 335xi MT Longevity,"Hello again!

&amp;#x200B;

Like I talked about in my last post here, I am in the process of buying an N54 6-speed 335xi that has been well maintained and only has 90k miles.  

To recap on the last post to save people the trouble of finding it, I'll quote directly from it.

&gt;The specifications are that the car is a 2008 335xi with a 6-speed MT.   The vehicle has 90k miles on it, and has only been driven about 500 miles in the last year.  It is a one-owner car who has done most of the work himself since 50k miles, with the exception of new dealer-installed turbos about 20k miles ago.  It has had the water pump replaced, as  well as new brakes, new Michelin Pilot Sport tires in the back, new spark plugs replaced 30k miles ago, and new Bilstein front coil-over springs and shocks.  This car also has a front clear bra installed.  He insists the car has never been beaten on, and he has never had to install any new clutch in this E90, or his E39 M5.  The man also says he has  all records and receipts available.

With this all being in mind, I am already trying to think about my future with this vehicle, and what modifications I want to commit to it.  I do not intend for this car to be a speed demon or anything, so as of now I want to keep my modifications subtle.  I was thinking Walnut Blasting when I can get the hardware for it (it has not been done yet, but he says there isn't any issue with idling or anything like that), maybe a JB4 tune, xDelete, an oil catch can, and at some point, a Borla catback exhaust.

&amp;#x200B;

What other modifications would this community make to me to make this car last longer (preferably bolt-on), and does anyone have any advice for what I'm planning to do?

The transmission is starting to down shift roughly and I don’t want to change the fluid only to have it crap out sooner than if I left it. I only worry that if something happens my warranty will be expired.

The one that got away,"My first experience with a driver-oriented vehicle was a mk6 GTI. Candy white, plaid seats, and a golf ball shifter. Unfortunately, I was stupid and caused a crash (took a turn to fast and went over the curb, damaging the frame and transmission along the process). In the aftermath, I had a chance to buy a E90 with low miles and just needing a few repair items. However, the car went in for a air bag recall and the tech crashed it. It gave me just enough time to get cold feet and go with a Mazda 3, a sensible choice. However, it was too slow to be that uncomfortable and too uncomfortable to be that slow.

Naturally, I came back to looking for a E90/E46 in decent shape. I ended up with a mk5 GTI, as the guy was selling it for a little over what Carmax was offering him (not much). A couple mods and it can be described as one bitchin ride. However, it still isn't a bona-fide Ultimate Driving Machine that the E90 was. The seating position is still too high, steering is a little floaty even if it is one of the better electric systems out there, and a turbo-4 is a compromise compared to something like, oh, a VR6.

I'm always just a little disappointed in myself that I let the worries of ""what if this happens"" or ""what if I have to foot a heavy repair bill"" to go through with the bimmer. It has classic design, a naturally aspirated inline 6, and comes with 3 pedals. 

I don't really know what this post is meant to be, but just a lamentation that the E90 has represented all that I admired about BMW and hardly anything from that era remains today.",E90,1545934369,opus666,3,1,True,2018-12-27

2006 BMW 325i Mirror issue,"Hi all, 

I've been having an issue with my driver side mirror on my 2006 BMW 325i.

&amp;#x200B;

When I purchased the vehicle from a used car lot I noticed that the mirror would reset in a position forward from normal. the car lot ""rebuilt"" the mirror and said the issue was the pin mechanism being corroded. By them rebuilding the mirror at first seemed to resolve the problem, however, after going to a car wash and folding the mirrors in, then letting them try to reset automatically while driving up to 25mph, the driver side mirror again reset to that weird position (all the way forward).  The only way I can get it back to the normal position is to manually push it back into place and even then it doesn't seem to be quite in the right position. Since it was past the 30-day warranty they gave me, I can't take it back to them. I do have a friend that can probably fix it, once I know what the problem is.

&amp;#x200B;

After again going to a different drive-through car wash and folding the mirrors in, the problem has gotten worse and now every time I park the car the driver side mirror goes back to that weird ""all the way forward position""

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody experience this issue or have a clue as to what's going on?

Question about auto transmission manual mode,"Hi.

Backstory: 
 used to have an e36 with a welded diff but I ended up getting a good offer on someone who wanted the project. 

With the extra cash I couldn’t pass up a 2007 328i automatic for a steal, slightly under $2000. I’m planning on welding the diff on this one too so I can get some seat time in this chassis and decide if I want an e90 for my next drift chassis. Thus the above question.

Automatic transmission fluid question,"So I bought my 2006 330i with around 124,000 miles as a one owner car. It is clear to me through the online visible repair reports that the previous owner greatly looked after the car by doing regular and scheduled maintenance at the BMW dealership. Would it be possible that they would have scheduled a automatic transmission fluid change at 100k? I'm aware that BMW call the fluid ""lifetime"" but it says that it is recommended (by the manufacturer) to change it every 100k miles. Only reason this is important for me is because I'm planning on keeping it a while. For the past year and 10,000 miles it's been shifting absolutely fine but still concerned about the far future.

2011 328i SULEV blower motor recall question?,"So I've noticed an occasional smoke smell with visible smoke coming out of the a/c vents on one occasion a few weeks ago and I can't figure out what's causing it, it does seem to happen the most when coming to a stop when getting off the highway and occasionally when starting the car  I looked up my cars service history and a few months before I bought it (I purchased the car on 11/2/2018 so I've only had it a little over 2 months) the VCG was replaced so I doubt it's that.  I took the car to a mechanic about a month a go to get the steering angle sensor re-calibrated and the plastic under body panels replaced and mentioned the smoke smell and the mechanic said he couldn't find any leaks and said the engine looked great.

I'm wondering if it might be the blower motor?  In the cars history I can't see anything about that recall work being performed, but when I look up the recalls on my car it says there are 0 open recalls.  Since no recalls are showing does it mean that the recall work was already done?  My car is a pretty late build date for a 2011 (07/12/2011) maybe it wasn't effected?

I'm really lost here and it's stressing me out a ton.  I'm hoping it's something minor like some dirt or leaves burning up occasionally (the under body panel was basically missing so it would have been easy enough for some stuff to get in), but I'm worried its something more major.

Any ideas?  Thank you! ",E90,1547762459,bimm3ric,6,1,True,2019-01-17

Advice on selling 335i in the future,"So a couple years ago I bought and 08 e90 335i with a problem in the engine (loud knocking). I got it for 4k Canadian has 114000km. I thought maybe I can have it fixes for less than 2k. After much opinions and asking around, that engine was gone and didn't want to repair. I eventually got a lead locally for a car 2010 335i with the same n54 engine. A bodyshop owned it, was a salvage car but nothing wrong with the front at all. The guy fixed the car but had electrical problems with Windows going up and down and couldn't fix and just let it set.  I bought the engine from him and majority of things connected to it( turbos, alternator etc.) Engine only has 12000 km. I found the right Indy shop and swapped the engine. Been working flawlessly since then. I don't drive it as much as I want to, it has 124000km now. 

I've done a lot to the car since then, more cosmetic then anything and I love it. I thought about selling because I'd like to get a pickup for work and can't keep both. How should I approach the sale in regards to its history. I personally feel it's valuable to the next owner to have a n54 engine with less than that low mileage. Also what do you think it's worth?

2008 328i transmission seems *too* notchy,"I have a 6MT 328i and the shifter is ridiculously notchy at times (particularly in this cold weather).   
I wanted to see if you guys experience the same things or is something up.  
  
-Mainly, it doesn't go from gear to gear. No matter how smooth it's shifting that day, it's always 3-N-4 or 1-N-2 etc. when shifting for me. You can manhandle it all you want but it won't go straight from a gear to a gear. It doesn't really hang up though, happens very quickly but noticeably stops at neutral as I said.  
  
-When shifting to first it hangs up for a couple seconds and an audible synchro whine can be heard. Not like a grind but a high pitched whine that gets higher pitched until it goes in all the way. Especially when still moving- I don't shift all the way to first but if I'm coming to a stop sign (ie won't be stopped long) I sometimes go to first and keep the clutch pushed in until I'm stopped and it's time to go again. This is usually when I hear it.  
  
-Occasionally hard to get it into first or reverse when I start it up (definitely when cold but sometimes after I've been driving all day- I deliver pizza). I'll sometimes have to slot it in second or third for a second before I can get into 1 or R  
  
-Flywheel chatter (I assume). In neutral with the clutch disengaged only (ie at a light) there's an audible chatter that only stops if I put the clutch in.  
  
-EXTREMELY temperamental in cold weather. It feels like a different car entirely at 20F than 80F  
  
-Really easy to grind gears. It's not like every day but I've grinded in it probably 20 times since I've owned it. Driven a shit ton of other cars (Hondas, BMW's, Hyundais, Fords, Toyotas, Miatas, Nissans) and have literally never grinded a gear in any other car but my own.  
  
I dunno. Just passed 150k miles. Clutch pedal seems fine and the clutch itself doesn't slip whatsoever. It's been taken pretty good care of by everyone who owned it.

The first one is lower miles on the whole car with a clutch replaced around 12k miles into it, and has a few scuffs on the front bumper, but seems a bit over priced.

The second one has a lot higher miles but had a reman engine put in and hasn't gained but a handful of miles since. The story behind the replaced engine is the guy who owned it was the general store manager for the dealership. When the engine ranked he gave himself a great trade in credit and shortly after was no longer employed by that dealership. The company kept the car and claim to have spent 8k having a reman engine installed by a BMW dealership.

I'm after a second opinion on both and why or why not, I'm currently blinded by black, awd and 6 speed meeting my criteria and need an outside opinion.

Low/leaking coolant after oil change,"I got an oil change on Friday. Came back and parked the car until today when I left for work. I noticed a small fluid stream going away from the car.  It was dried up but looked like it was blue and had spots of black in it. 

I had to do the short drive to work. (not ideal but I had to go) On the way I got a low coolant warning. When I pulled in I had a little steam coming from the right side of the hood. I popped the hood and noticed the coolant cap wasn't screwed on all the way. 

It's my understanding the coolant system is pressurized. Could it have boiled over when I got back from the oil change and that's why it's low? Is there something else that could have happened from the oil change? Do I have another issue?

* Had very small amount of steam coming out from the front of the radiator before the oil change. Seemed to be an intermittent problem and I thought it might have been the current weather.

Oil Low Light on Idle,"Hello,

Just curious if any of you have any insight on this situation:
* Was on a road trip last weekend and was idling for about 3 minutes. The yellow Oil Level Low light came on so I drove over to Canadian Tire and picked up 1L. 
* Turned the car back on and the sensor was reading that the oil was at max, so I didn’t want to pour any in.
* Drove 100km, whole time reading its at max and OK. Pulled into a parking lot to check it, turn car off and on and now reading that I need to pour in 1L. I was paranoid at this point so I poured in .75L and finished the drive.
*On the way home, it was reading full the whole trip (400km) but while I was idling in a car wash at home, it was then reading that the oil was low. I didn’t put any in. 

Been driving it last few days and its reading that its full.

Extra info:
* Last oil change was 8,000KM ago and I don’t think I put the full 6.9L in. Most likely was around 6/6.5. 
* Car is a 2009 BMW 328xi.

My thoughts is that the oil level is right around the good/not good level which explains the readings but maybe it’s the senor? I'm also a rookie as u can probably tell by now lol

I’m thinking of getting an oil change ASAP and seeing what happens after that.

Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated. 
Cheers!

I had a pretty early morning flight and had to get to the airport at 03:00. Needless to say I was a little tired.

It definitely brightened my day and made me love this car even more. 

Sorry I don't have pics the only one I have is a pretty bad dealer picture 🙄. I gotta get a few good ones taken sometime.

2010 BMW 320 diesel efficient dinamics, E90.

(Best) fuel injectors for N47?,"First of all, sorry if my question comes across as stupid, I really don't know much about cars.  
This morning during a routine check at my local indie we noticed there was a fault code related to the electric part of the solenoid fuel injectors in one of the cylinders. The mechanic told me that it could be a ghost code considering I've never experienced any change while driving because I would definitely feel a change going from 4 to 3 cylinders. He deleted the log and told me to come back in 10 days to see if it fires up again. Also told me that I shouldn't look at buying a new one (if the need arises) due to the local prices (official dealership sells it for 600 euros a piece) and that my best bet would be to get one from a disassembled engine. I don't like the odds of buying important parts that way mainly because of no warranty.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm looking online to see how the prices go. I checked [Realoem.com](http://www.realoem.com/bmw/enUS/showparts?id=PG11-EUR-03-2011-E90N-BMW-318d&amp;diagId=13_1225#13537798446), the part number there is 13537798446, so I went to Ebay and using their filters I came across [this one](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/BOSCH-INJECTOR-DIESEL-INJECTOR-BMW-3-Series-13537808089-0445115077-0986435359/123060229659?fits=Car+Make%3ABMW%7CModel%3A3+Series%7CCars+Type%3A318d%7CPlat_Gen%3AE90%7CCars+Year%3A2011%7CVariant%3AE90+%5B2004-2011%5D+Saloon&amp;epid=248908577&amp;hash=item1ca6f6161b:g:0OMAAOSwcxVax1mT:rk:3:pf:1&amp;frcectupt=true) , but the difference is the part numbers don't match. I am fairly certain that it's the correct part for the correct car. I have several questions:

1. Has anyone used 'aftermarker' injectors like this one from Bosch? Are there any issues when not using OEM ones? Fault codes etc etc?
2. If using non-OEM is an option, which are the best brands and should I expect (at least approximately) a similar lifespan as the OEMs?

If it makes and difference, I have a 318d from 2011 wearing the N47T engine

I have a 2011 328i with 73k miles on it. Turned her over today and started hearing a weird squeaking noise from the engine bay and popped the hood. Sounds like it's coming from the pulleys but not sure? If anyone knows what this is, let me know!

I miss my first car....,"Hey all, first time poster here and new BMW driver! (soon)

I bought a 318i 2007 in Mai this year as my first car ever at the age of 29. 

The car dealer had just gotten this car in and it wasnt ready for sale just yet.  That was ok for me, as they informed me that it had some fixing to do. This was the only car i could find in my Town that was to my likings. So we made a deal that i buy it, and they fix it after. This is all writen in contract so thats good. They then fixed it, and had me come pick it up.  

1 week later  i noticed an insane amount of oilburn, it drank a full tank of oil on 80km with no leakage that could be seen outside. I called the dealer and they took it in for a new check. This was in Mai... And im still not driving my car as its still at the workshop. 

As of now they've changed almost everything on the engine, but hey... good for me as i dont have to pay for it. 

Just wanted to vent , hope i get to drive it alot soon.

Need Advice,"About a week ago I've been having this weird issue with my 2007 335i. After a day of driving the car the battery will be completely drained the following morning. Replaced battery, checked alternator. Nothing fixed the issue.

This all started happening after the fuse that controls the front dash died. I replaced the fuse and the next day the battery was drained.

Took it to a local mechanic and he did a load test and it showed that 1.5 amps was being pulled from the fuse box while the car was off. 

He suggested to take it to a BMW mechanic to make sure that it's a fuse box problem. 

I'm just looking to see if anyone has had any similar experiences or any advice.

really considering buying a used 335i,"So I've recently been in the market for a 2010-2012 Evo X (especially Wicked White), they respond so well to mods and I wanted a ""newer"" car, thats why I decided against the Evo 8/9.

I currently have a 2004 G35 coupe 6MT, and it's hard to get any real power without going turbo+built internals, but I'm dissapointed that my car feels newer than either Evo/WRX from the driver seat, just not a mod friendly car to be honest. I'm very interested in the BMW, but reading reliability issues in the HPFP, fuel rails/injectors, and water pump. also, upkeep probly isn't cheap, but with the money I'm saving it's still seems worth it. question to you BMW owners, is there a way to get aftermarket HPFP, water pump and other parts that are more reliable than OEM? ive seen a few forums, and they just say to get a FMIC, charge pipe, and catch can to help with reliability, but what about the known problems?",E90,1544048209,J___A,33,1,True,2018-12-05
"328xi Lower U-joint steering shaft noise - Should I fix it ASAP?

Dove under the car and realized that it was the lower U-joint on the steering shaft making the squeaking. I’ve tried everything so far to get rid of the squeak, including slathering it with grease, but still to no avail.

Car has 229k kms on it so this sort of expensive repair isn't out of the ordinary but I'm not sure it should be this much. Apparently the sensor has to come from Germany and they'll need to take the seat out.

Bought a 11' 335xi Coupe... Where do I start?,"Disclaimer: This is not a bad news post :)

So as you can see I recently bought a 335xi. I want to start looking into upgrading pretty much everything and anything I can. Not really focused on power just yet but I'd like to do some other things. Mostly cosmetic for now but I have no idea where to start. 

For example I want to upgrade the headlights. Do I have to buy anything specific if I want to put the brighter LED angel eyes? What about the lights in general if I want them a little brighter? 

What websites does everyone use when buying parts?

Randomly stalling 2006 330xi?,"Hi, all. My 330XI has randomly stalled 3 times now in the past two months. For some context it started right after I replace the valve cover gasket due to it leaking oil into the cylinders (home job). The first time was on my first drive after replacing it. It stalled, I shut it off and turned it on and drove it home fine and there was no signs of anything wrong except for the stall. The second time was about 10 later as I came off the highway. Again I turned it off and on and it worked fine. Come today I just filled up gas (I rotate between 89 and 93 since there isn't a 91 option, but if this is bad please let me know) and it stalled. Again I pulled over and turned it off and on and it runs perfect. The first time I was going about 50mph, the second about 30 and just today about 40. I also drive a lot so I would say it happens only every 1000 miles.

Repair history:

Not two weeks after I bought the car while on a home visit for the hospice I worked for at the time a family member had side swiped my door and nobody would take responsibility for it and at the time the deductible was too much to pay so i dealt with a small dent on the drivers side fender and door for around two years. During the next few years I had the oil routinely changed, changed the break pads and sensors myself a few times, had new tires installed, replaced the starter myself (which was a pain in the you know what). The two years ago, right before Christmas, all at once both rear power windows quit working and then while I was in a store shopping my car got side swiped while parked in the same spot as the previous time which ended up being a blessing because the person who hit me left their information and paid for the repairs of the b damage they caused and subsequently the damage for the previous sideswipe. While it was in the shop I also had them replace both window regulators in the rear windows so the car was back mostly in tip top shape. Then a few weeks later I misjudged backing out of a narrow parking lot and dropped the front off of the curb and broke the front driver side fender (show inf album). Then last summer it started overheating and I had a shop replace the water pump. then more recently a year to the date of the last side swipe my car was vandalizes and had a nice dent put in the hood and the windshield busted while at work in the hospital, had the windshield replaced but again couldn't afford the deductible for the bodywork for the hood. Then just like that both rear windows stopped working again. Then my car got stolen from my driveway because I was an idiot and left my extra fob in the center console for reasons unknown. Luckily it was recovered and only a few things had been stolen from inside the car and the fob, no important car paperwork etc. I had an inspection done after it was recovered to see if it was tampered with in any way which it appears it wasn't but then I got an overwhelming list of fixes that need attention and I am just at my wits end thinking about dealing with them.

Anyway, I really appreciate any advice/suggestions you guys might have in regards to possibly selling my vehicle. Here is a link to a photo album of my car and the inspection report: [https://imgur.com/a/a7BzKUG](https://imgur.com/a/a7BzKUG)

DIY strut job suuuuucks,"So, I just spent the whole weekend swapping the totally worn-out front struts and stabilizer bar links on my 2006 330i with sport suspension.

There are several write-ups online.  They are mostly useful; the problem is, nobody warns you that the spring doesn't compress enough!  

The problem is, sport suspension springs are shorter (I think?) than the regular ones.  That means there's less to grab onto, so the spring compressor set (the rental one from Auto Zone) can only grab about two thirds the spring.  Even if you tighten it all the way down, the top hat pop off when you loosen the bolt that holds it on because there's still a bit of pressure on it.  Basically, that means the spring is too tall for the mounting kit to go back on... because it can't compress far enough... because it's a sport spring and is too short for the compressor to grab enough of it.  

Basically, it's a massive pain in the ass and you NEED two people to be able to do it without a fancy shop-grade pneumatic spring compressor.  

Here's what my buddy and I did (starting with the spring and old strut already out):

* Put the new strut into the carrier and tap it in.

* Put the bump stop and boot on the strut and place the spring, then position the top hat over it.

* Position the new strut mount on the car and finger-tighten the nuts to hold it in place.

* Swing it all back under the fender.

* Position a floor jack under the control arm and jack it up enough to barely make contact but not lift it up (yet).  At this point, one person should be manning the jack and the other maneuvering the strut assembly.   

* Maneuver the strut assembly so that the shaft is pointing up toward the mount kit, then start slowly jacking it up.  The jack will lift the entire suspension up into the wheel well.  The goal is to get the strut shaft up through the washer and into the mount kit.  Be prepared to try multiple times, swear profusely, and (gasp) consider a Toyota or some other peasant car.  (You *will* need two people: one to operate the jack, one to maneuver the strut assembly.)

* Once the strut shaft is through the top hat, the washer, and the strut mount, you can thread the nut onto it and tighten it down.  This will allow you to remove your spring compressors and begin the arduous task of reassembling the rest of the suspension.

This whole process took me about ten hours between yesterday and today.  Some of that time was spent trying to do what I described above, but by myself.  This is impossible; don't attempt it.  You. Need. Two. People.

I am now the proud owner of a 330i with a brand spankin' new suspension (I did the rear shocks in the spring).  It does ride really nice, *but at what cost?*

Jokes aside, I had two shops quote the work, one local indie that specializes in BMWs ($1,200 P&amp;L) and a Midas ($900 P&amp;L).  I got quality German parts from FCP Euro for ~ $300 and did it myself.  Spent a weekend, saved $600 minimum.  8/10, would do again.  ",E90,1536545157,three-one-seven,3,6,True,2018-09-09

The current wheel setup I have are BMW style 284's which are 17x8 et34 with 225/45/17 tires.

&amp;#x200B;

The wheels i'm looking at are \[Varrstoen ES1's\]([https://i.imgur.com/BS3nucd.jpg?1](https://i.imgur.com/BS3nucd.jpg?1)) and i'd be running 19x8.5 et30 with 235/35/19 in the front and 19x9.5 et35 with 265/30/19 tires in the rear. I know the setup will fit (maybe with some slight fender rolling in the rear) and I checked to make sure the total diameters were close enough to stock.

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem left is finding out whether or not staggered works well with X-Drive, if not i'll have to run a squared setup and maybe use spacers in the back or something.

The USB option on my radio eventually disappears and comes back up a few minutes later, but starts this process all over again.

I have an 2009 BMW 335i that I have FBO’s on and had a buddy of mine install a FMIC for me, as he did this he left the thermostat unbolted (in his words: “the new 3 inch pipes that lead to the thermostat were a bit bigger than the stock ones so it was hard to get the thermostat bolted back in”)

The hose that leads from the transmission to the front of the car to cool the oil down kept making contact with the fan and eventually started leaking until my transmission ran out of oil. Thank god for sensors because my transmission went into limp mode and I got the hose replaced and oil added into the transmission.

The only thing now though is that I get these two error codes when I plug my Carly module into the OBD port, and the car jerks when it’s switching gears (3rd gear - between 60km/h and 80kmp/h (35-50 mi/h) - it is very noticeable in sport mode and not noticeable at all in normal driving unless accelerating hard where you’ll feel the transmission kick slightly)

Windshield washers smudging from too many wipes?,"When I use the washer jets to clean my windshield it wipes way too many times after the windshield is dry.

If I spray the washers, the windshield is dry and clean after 2 or 3 swipes of the wipers but mine goes on and on 4 or 5 times causing a bunch of nasty white smudges to appear again. Making it even worse than before I spray them. (Sometimes I even hold it for like 10 seconds)

I bought new wipers (trico) 3 months ago and that didn't fix it. Today I bought a different brand (rain-x) and poured rain-x washer fluid but it's still not fixing the issue. 

Drives me nuts and is very distracting 😫

Is there a way I could code it to only wipe 3 times?

Eccentric Shaft Sensor codes after Valve Cover Gasket replacement - N52,"Hey everyone, would love some insight or help on this problem.

Have my 2009 328i Xdrive at a local indy mechanic who specializes in BMW/Merc getting a Valve Cover Gasket replaced caused I noticed some smoke around the engine from oil burning.   

So after the mechanic completed the Valve Cover Gasket replacement he said that now the Eccentric Shaft Sensor is no longer working and he needs to take everything apart again and replace it (another 4+ hours labour).  The mechanic asked me if I wanted to replace the sensor before he did the gasket, but he said the sensor was totally dry so I decided to leave it. 

Basically I'm just wondering if it's actually possible that the sensor failed at the exact moment they replaced the gasket, or if it's more likely that they damaged the sensor during the gasket replacement.

Looking for information about the specific changes tune maps make to the engine,"I'm looking at the JB4 tune, and I'm wondering exactly what changes are being made at each of the map levels. I have the map list from the manufacturer here:

* Map 0: Stock bypass. 
* Map 1: 13psi. Suggested for most racing applications.
* Map 2: 14.5psi. Suggested for those with intake and other bolt on modifications with 93 RM2 or higher octane.
* Map 3: Progressive WMI water injection mapping with failsafe. 
* Map 4: Stock map w/ CAN active. Allows full logging and in dash gauges on the stock mapping.
* Map 5: Autotuning map. Boost ranges between 12-17psi based on your cars octane, conditions, and modifications. E85 compatible. If using E85 we suggest around 30% to start. Refer to the E85 FAQ for addl info. Resets to 93 octane level adaptions when selected and adjusts itself up or down from there.
* Map 6: User defined map generally only used for diagnostics or troubleshooting. 
* Map 7: Race gas map. 18.5psi peak boost on the G5 ISO. Requires straight 100-104+ RM2 octane unleaded racing fuel. Never run leaded fuel. To use this map with E85 requires the E85 back end flash, inline booster fuel pump, and a 40%+ E85 mix, per E85 FAQ.
* Map 8: Valet low boost map. May trigger 30FF under boost code in cars not also equipped with the back end flash map.

What this *doesn't* tell me is, what makes Map 1 produce 13psi boost? Is it simply changing fuel and valve timing mappings? Is it disabling any engine safety features to do this? How much will it reduce the life expectancy of my catalytic converters?

Do these sound like symptoms of a bad Crankshaft Position Sensor? 2007 328xi,"Hello all,

If this type of post is not permitted please let me know and I will remove it. 

I'm looking for help regarding an issue that popped up in my car recently. Yesterday morning I was driving when I heard my car chime, and on the console the yellow ""car on lift"" icon was showing while iDrive said ""Malfunction in Drive, continued driving possible, reduced acceleration, take car to nearest BMW center"" and below it said ""Malfunction in transmission"". Car also went into limp mode here. At this point I started to freak out a bit, so I stopped, turned the car off and on and the issue went away for a few hours. This morning when I went to drive again, the same notification came up, and I started to notice a lack of power in my car. It doesn't feel like it's in limp mode this time, it honestly feels more like a misfire. The car will accelerate, but there is way less power and the acceleration seems a bit off, as opposed to linear and consistent when normal. Under acceleration the RPMs ""stutter"" a bit, as in the car's RPMs will go up a little bit, stop very quickly, go up again, etc until it shifts. When coming to a red light the RPM's will dip very low to 300-500 and then go back to about 1000. The car has a long crank, about 5 seconds each time before starting, however, it hasn't not started or died on me while driving so far. SES light is on alongside the iDrive transmission message.

I took the car to get scanned at Autozone since BMW is closed today and two codes came back:

P0335 - Crankshaft position sensor A malfunction

P1727 - Blank code? Can't seem to find what exactly this code is, except that it usually pops up with the crankshaft code.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has had a similar problem and what it ended up being. I was very worried I had some sort of mechanical transmission problem, but when using the Tiptronic I have no problem shifting and all gears are working, there's just still the lack of power and uneven acceleration. I believe this is an electrical/sensor issue rather than a mechanical one. I'll be taking the car down to BMW tomorrow to see, but in the meantime, I wanted to see if anyone from the community could help.

Thank you all very much in advance!

Question about fluid replacements,"So I've decided to replace many of the ""lifetime"" fluids now that I'm at 106k mi for the longevity of the car ('08 335xi). Power steering and coolant fluids are done so far and I've also bought the oil for the transfer case, differentials, and transmission.

I realized that it would be a good idea to get new plugs for the differentials as I hear they have gaskets built in?

My questions are:

- From what I want to replace, which plugs will I need to buy? Just for the differentials, or for the transfer case and transmission as well? I know the transfer case and transmission have separate drain/fill plugs, should I replace them all?

- As far as the transfer case fluid change goes, I've heard you need to reset the adaptations to avoid other problems. Is this still the case for my manual transmission, or is that only the case for automatics? I have Carly for BMW, it is supposedly capable of resetting it for the automatic transmission, but not sure if it just is inapplicable for the manual gearbox.

"Expansion Tank/Water Pump Replacement, still getting ""low coolant"" warning","2011 335i xdrive sedan

I've been fighting with this problem for the past few weeks now and I'm hoping to find a solution on here.

I received a low coolant warning and after doing some research on here looked under the hood and noticed some white spots around my expansion tank's seam. Reading that it was a common problem I ordered a new tank (Rein, not OEM, important later) that I installed with minimal issues.

A few days later the expansion tank is dry again. I cave and take it to a reputable BMW mechanic who informs me that my water pump and thermostat need to be replaced. $1100 later and it's all replaced, but the low coolant warning will not go away. I performed the bleed procedure 2 times and still nothing, so I take it back to the mechanic. He swapped the aftermarket sensor for an OEM one, but the warning still did not go away. He told me that the sensor sits in a cavity underneath the expansion tank and he suspects that the aftermarket plastic might be too thick for the sensor to read the coolant level, hence the warning.

Anyone else ever experience this? I know the 2011 expansion tank is different than the older E90s, but this seems crazy that the low coolant warning won't go away. Should i replace the expansion tank with OEM for 4 times the price of the non-oem?  Before I do this I wanted to see if anyone else ever experience this.",E90,1533222824,mitsitsad,1,2,True,2018-08-02

E90 2011 - Alignment questions,"Hey guys, 

Have a 2011 E90 - 6 speed X DRIVE with 150 000 KM

Short story, I bought it back in May had badly worn tires so I went out and bought some new tires. The steering wheel was off center BEFORE the tire change and I wanted to make sure it wasn't just tire related. With the new tires, still off center and pretty much the same error on the wheel.

Took it in to a ""reputable"" shop and had it aligned with the new tires, they did a quick inspection on it as well, nothing was brought up.

After first alignment - felt bouncy on the road, and the wheel was still off. 

Brought it back in he realigned it and found some measurements that were out of spec, claimed to correct them and took it for a test drive claiming it was all good.

After second alignment - Wheel still off center.

brought it back they found some more measurements out of spec (different ones on the rear) but this time it was a different dude. He said ""I put all your measurements in SPEC but I can't put your wheel perfectly straight as your inner and outer left tie rods are too rusty on the threads to get it perfect.

They want me to replace both parts which is pretty expensive and they offer free alignment from there.

What do you guys think? 3 alignments to find out ONE of my tie rods isn't adjustable ""enough"" ? Could they have played around so much with it that THEY actually damaged it?",E90,1534271369,MaTArcher,6,4,True,2018-08-14

MAF Sensor Issues?,"2008 BMW 328i

Fault: Having issues holding idle with MAF sensor connected. Various throttle control codes being thrown including P0123, P1637, P1417, P1105 and P110D. Engine temperature reported by OBD2 scantool as ~210F.

Symptoms when MAF disconnected: Throttle control codes clear, replaced by P116E (expected) and no idle issues. Engine temperature reported by OBD2 in the 170-180F range. 

I can understand a faulty MAF sensor messing with the idle, and I could even see the computer possibly blaming it on the throttle control as that happened on my E36. But the 35 degree change in engine operating temperature is baffling me. I'm aware that the MAF sensor on E90s are also the intake air temp sensor but this is strange behavior even under those circumstances to me. Note that when i plug the MAF in I watch the extra 35 degrees build up and when I disconnect it I watch it bleed them off over time. Is 210F the normal operating temperature or is something funky going on with my MAF sensor/vacuum system?

Also the throttle control stuff is only showing up if the engine temperature goes above 190F, which happens all the time if the MAF is connected. Not sure if I should go ahead and order a new throttle body in case the throttle control and TPS are on their way out or just start with a new MAF and see if that solves all my problems",E90,1525408969,SiliconOverlord27,2,3,True,2018-05-03

Wheel fitment question,"I have a wheel fitment question regarding my car. I have a 2007 328i rear wheel drive. It is the base model. It currently has what I believe is the style 156 wheels. 

I bought a set of style 138 wheels with the et20 offset for a rear wheel drive e60. I jumped the gun. Usually I do a lot more research but I wanted to know if using them would cause any problems(i haven't bought tires). 

They are narrow enough that even with the offset I so not think they will rub. There are wider wheels that can come standard on an e90 that stick out farther than the difference in the offset. I am not sure how much they would impact my handling.

I am looking to autocross in mostly stock form. I was having trouble finding used e90 wheels that would work and came across these. I realize they are not as wide as i might be able to go but also with a car that is fully stock I would know that I would need a ton of tire anyways. 

I would appreciate any help. I was hoping to go with a 17 or 18 inch wheel to get something a little wider that looks good. I was also trying to stay budget oriented which is why I didn't go aftermarket because a decent used set can be half the price.

Bumper repair help,"I bought my 2008 328i last month. Amazing car and amazingly well serviced. He hasn’t coated/waxed/polished the paint in some time, which is noticeable to me but not to anyone else most likely. There’s only been two issues Ive encountered so far. 

1. The brake lights are on (more on this later)
2. The front bumper is scraped on the bottom and the corner by driver side fender is cracked and has paint stripped. 

He explained the brake light was on because he didn’t change out the break wear sensors when he changed the brakes, as he avoided most maintenance costs by DIYing a lot of his own work. Fair enough, but when should I look into replacing my brakes and sensors? I have service records for everything he’s done.

As for the main point, should I save up and buy a whole new bumper + paint it, or should I buy one of those bumper repair kits and use some touch up paint? 

I really don’t know what the better option would be here. I’d like to make my bimmer as beautiful as possible, and any help is appreciated. I’d like to take the car to some scenic areas for photo shoots but the messed up paint and the crack in the bumper kind of ruin that aesthetic. 

TLDR: What’s the best method of repairing a 
mildly cracked bumper as well as re-applying the paint on the bottom and corner? ",E90,1526923570,RagingAesthetic,5,3,True,2018-05-21

Engine Running Hot,"So when I ride my 2008 328i a little too hard, the engine bay smells bad afterwards. Like something is running too hot. I just topped off on coolant last week, and engine oil is right where it’s supposed to be. 

Could there be something wrong I don’t know about? It only happens when I accelerate from ~50 to 90+ quickly. I’m aware any type of rapid acceleration to high speeds isn’t good for the car, but is there a cooling system malfunction I should look out for?

I’ve been very conscious of preventative maintenance outside of this issue, and I’ve been looking at new radiators and cold air intakes to help with the excess heat. 

Also, IDK if it matters but I still have the protective hood liner on the car.

BMW 2011 328xi - Short shifter / Shifter bushings," Hi guys,  
 

Have been reading around and looking at a bunch of videos, forum posts  on installing a short shifter for the BMW E90. ""Cosmo Racing"" sells an affordable short shifter kit for the E90 and after a few exchanges with the contact up there he confirmed his part was compatible with my 2011 328xi.  


Anyways so I tear into the project, remove the knob, boot, the console  trim and the rubber sleeve on the shifter this took me 5 minutes tops.  Then the plate that supports the ball ""socket"" is much larger/covers  more area than shown on most E90 tutorials and does not allow access to  the shifter linkage to remove the clip and take it apart. Some tutorials  state that the car needs to be jacked up to access this so  I Tried  sneaking under the car with some ramps and looking around with a light I  just don't get how you can access the fricking thing even for someone  who just wants to replace the bushings on the linkage?  
 

Am I missing something? Has anybody else experienced this when either  attempting bushing replacement OR wanting to install a short shifter  kit? \(SSK\)

How expensive is owning a E90?,"Hi. I chickened out of getting a E90 a few months back after getting some repair estimate from a pre\-purchase inspection. The valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and the oil filter housing gaskets all needed replacing and came out to nearly $2000. That and the fact that I knew a Mazda3 offered most of the driving experience at far below the operating cost led me to make a compromise choice. 

Now, that E90 is back in the market and I am giving it a long hard look \(and it's not the only thing that's long and hard\). The 3 series is all I could want in a car. RWD, inline 6, manual trans, superb handling, and a lot of gravitas.  You don't get that today. And I think this is why I am in such a quandary, because this is a dying breed of cars. Straight line speed and creature comforts are plenty with modern cars but none can be hailed as the ultimate driving machine as the E36/46/90 can be.

My only reservation about this car is running costs. What can I expect to spend on regular maintenance in a given year, and what would be a worst\-case\-scenario in terms of repairs?",E90,1527089650,opus666,46,10,True,2018-05-23

Thermostat hose failure,"As I was pulling into my office garage today, I noticed the power steering stopped working and steam started coming out of the hood. I turned the engine off, opened up the hood, and discovered that there was coolant all over the place. It looks like the thermostat hose had disconnected, which caused coolant to spray all over the place

I'm trying to determine to proceed here. I'm not sure if it's just the thermostat hose that failed, or if the real culprit is that a bad water pump and/or thermostat, which put too much pressure on the hose. I'm somewhat handy and think I could probably replace the water pump, thermostat and hose if necessary, but I don't want to risk damaging the vehicle. Should I have it towed or try fixing the hose and adding coolant and driving it the 10 minutes or so back to my house? Has anyone had experience with this before?

Rear Spoiler Help,"I am trying to look for a new spoiler for my car and wanted to get some recommendations from you all.

A/C issue - recall + Question,"After many trips to independent garages. Lots of bits changed and lots of posts here, it seemed apparent I had a serious gremlin in my 335d e90. The A/C simply doesn’t work.

While taking a dump at work yesterday I simply googled the VIN within the Government Vehicle website and low and behold, a recall on the blower wiring system. Not quite sure of the issue.

I am confident this must be the issue as every other aspect has been replaced on the vehicle.

I took the vehicle out for a drive yesterday, pushed the gearbox to the left, traction off and spend over an hour abusing the car, I genuinely forgot how powerful that torque is... 

I have a question 

When the vehicle is parked, it seems the turbo boost pipe is leaking, I have had the red “condom” bmw OEM replaces with a performance part but still a leak is present.

Has anyone else resolved this leak?

Full Wrap or Repaint?,"First off, I know both are somewhat expensive.  Montego blue is a nice color and all, but I really would prefer black or that cool iridescent oil slick wrap. I don’t really want to have paintwork done, but my car isn’t perfect.

I’m really at a stand-still here. I would buy the wrap and do it myself with a knowledgeable friend if the car didn’t have a door ding and two high spots on the hood. I don’t want to just sand and Bondo the spots that need it and cover it with a wrap, either. It’s a higher class lady, not a Honda Civic.

2011 e90 328i MPG Drop and observations with increased milage.,"I have a 2011 328i Auto. I've owned it for about a year and a half and always consistently got the following milage.   


I bought the car with 53km miles. It now has 85k miles. 

Mixed city/highway: 24.7  


Highway cruise at 65-70: 34-36 sometimes 38 (cruise control between 65-70) I've managed close to 30mpg at 80 before as well.   


I have not changed my driving habits or type of fuel. After one fill up, I noticed the MPG was more sparatic from the live gauge reading and really dropped, but on my next fill up it settled to the lower averages.   


Spark plugs have less than 5k on them, Air filter is maybe 6months old or less.   


I put 30k miles on the car in 1.5 years and always saw these numbers.   


Pretty suddenly my fuel consumption has dropped  


Mixd city/highway: 20-22  


Highway cruise 65-70: 24-29  


Over all it is now averaging about 20-21mpg, 22 mixed if I drive like a grandma but highway cruising used to be much better.   


Oil is always OEM spec every 5-7k. On my last oil change it maintained the listed higher mpg up to the 7kmi on oil change mark. I'm a little over 4k on this oil change now and it has been reading lower as listed since about 2500miles on this oil change. The ECM was updated right after I got the car last year. [Tires](http://www.tirerack.com/a.jsp?a=AB2&amp;url=index.jsp) and wheels have not been changed. I have not had any engine related repairs done on the car. It is 100&amp;#37; factory stock. Only thing I have noticed is that on full acceleration in sport mode from stop or slow roll to -60mph (which I rarely do) between the top of 2nd and 3rd gear it seems to hesitate or slip slightly. I have noticed that the car seems to shift slowly and deliberately sometimes at random. Sometimes cruising or sometimes under heavy acceleration, but as far as I remember, it's always been that way with our oh so wonderful electronic throttle control....I did notice recently that this seemed more pronounced when I accelerated from 0-60 full throttle or from 20mph or so in sport mode (which rarely do). This seemed more exaggerated between gears 2-3, almost like a slip. But my car has always hunted a bit at low throttle going up and down hills (still always attributed this to throttle position sensor just being annoying from the factory) but I could be wrong.   


To make it short, I have not noticed any repetitive issues. I may need new motor mounts, as the care vibrates slightly at idle, especially with the AC on and this seems to affect my my MPG more than it has in the past. In cold weather, I sometimes have a pretty noticeable lifter tick on a cold start or short trips in the cold, but that has gone away since the weather has warmed up. for a short period of time, I had a few rough cold starts a little while after getting the car. It would hunt for a second or two, or sometimes sputter a bit and shake for maybe 3-5 seconds. But that only happened a few times over a year ago and has never repeated itself. The car never threw any hard codes. Once it threw a ""reduced Power"" code over a year ago briefly, but it went away and never came back. I had the ECU updated/reset to factory and changed the spark plugs after the odd behaving cold starts and this seemed to fix that, but nothing else. These are all small things have never caused any problems. The car has been really solid for almost a year with no problems. It is possible that it may have the original coils, and I know it has the original injectors.",E90,1530211971,wolverinesss,4,3,True,2018-06-28

Guess I ought to step up my track toolset game,"Long story short, I ended up cutting a track event short for what turned out to be a kinda dumb reason.

Background: I track my 335i somewhat regularly. Late last year I ran into a misfire issue on the street, across multiple cylinders, and at that time I decided to replace all the coils and plugs. I figured I didn't know their age, and I'd had the car for about 20k miles, so it was probably worth doing even without confirmation. After that the misfires got better but I'd still get some on cold starts. I suspected that I might have an injector or two going bad, but instead of replacing them, I ran a couple tanks of gas with Techron additive hoping to forestall an expensive injector replacement. Lo and behold, the misfiring went away, and last month, I ran a track event with no car issues whatsoever. Hooray!

This past weekend didn't go so well. Towards the end of my third session, the car began misfiring badly. I had this happen once before, and it was a transient condition that didn't recur, so this time I elected to just end my session a bit early and not do any troubleshooting. Unfortunately, fourth session was the same - this time, before I even finished my out lap, the misfiring started. I ducked into the hot pits, checked the code with the JB4 app - ok, just cylinder 4 misfiring. I suspected it *might* be heat related, so I cleared the code and turned on the JB4 Maxcool feature, then went back out. Nope, three corners in, misfire is back, boo hiss.

At this point I figured that maybe the possible injector issue had come to a head, but I did want to eliminate any other possible causes. Tried doing a couple WOT runs after leaving the track, car performed fine. This seemed to indicate that it was *something* about being on-track causing the issue. I spent that evening at the hotel doing some research, and developed a plan for the next day. In case it *was* a heat issue, I'd go ahead and pull the cowling in the morning to provide better cooling airflow. I also added another bottle of Techron with my morning fill-up.

I decided that if I still got a misfire in the first session, I'd come in, revert to stock boost levels, and try again, this time grabbing a data log with the JB4. And yup, that's exactly what happened. Data log ruled out other possibilities like LPFP or HPFP (though I figured those were unlikely since it was only one cylinder). Welp, guess it's the injectors, time to pack it up and go home.

The only slightly good news here was that I could now trigger the misfire with just any old WOT run, not having to be on the track. Car still drove fine as long as I was judicious with the throttle.

Once I got home, I decided to do some basic coil/plug troubleshooting for good measure. Swapped 3/4 coils, went for a drive, misfire stayed on 4. Swapped 3/4 plugs, went for a drive, misfire moved to 3. Well fuck, looks like it's a plug issue after all. I still had the last set of plugs lying around, so I picked the best-looking one and swapped it with #3. Didn't have a chance to drive until going to work this morning, but two WOT runs gave me no misfires at all.

Toolwise, I pack fairly light for the track, only taking stuff I know I'll need - torque wrench, correct socket for the lugs, battery impact if I'm going to swap wheels, that's about it. Part of me thinks I should add a basic socket and allen set in case I need to pull the cowl and engine cover again, and maybe some spare plugs and coils. Could be useful to salvage a weekend if this happens again. It goes against my light-packing policy, but really this isn't much inflation of my go box. And it'd be nice to not again end a weekend early, only to cime home and fix the problem with about half an hour invested in total.

E91 or E60 Consideration for first BMW.,"Hi guys!

I know that this is an E90 forum, but I need your all's opinion on which one of these I should get.

So after passing up on a car that I found out had been in some major wrecks, I've found a couple more options as my very first BMW.

The first one is a 2008 328xi sport wagon that has about 82,000 miles. All regular maintenance done at BMW and no wrecks. No record however of water pump, thermostat or VCG replaced.

The second one is a 2010 535 i xDrive sport wagon with about 75,000. Clean carfax report with only one previous owner. All repairs and maintenance done at a BMW dealer. Carfax shows that fuel injectors were replaced in October 2012 AND December 2012, and the fuel pump was replaced in December 2017.

Based on everyone's experience here, which one do you think would be the better, more reliable option for a daily driver? I'm in the IT field and drive around to different clients frequently.

First e90 Maintenance!,"Hello. I recently bought my first ever bmw, a 2006 325i e90. It’s a blast to drive and has no problems however it does have 135k miles and does not have a clear maintenance history. I need to drive the car 16 hours up to school by the end of summer, and really wanted to bulletproof it. Here’s the maintenance i’m planning on doing so far, i’d love suggestions for other common failure points in the car where i could benefit from some preventative maintenance.

-Redoing valve cover gasket
-Oil pan gasket
-Oil filter housing gasket 
-Oil level sensor O ring
-Oil and filter change (duh)
-Shifter rebuild 
-Vanos solenoid valve sealing gaskets 
-Vanos Actuator Gasket 
-Upper/Lower radiator hoses
-Thermostat
-Coolant temp sensor 
-Coolant flush
-Power steering fluid flush
-Brake fluid flush
-Air and cabin filter 
-Extra bosch coil in the trunk 
-Drive belt 
-Diff fluid flush 
-Transmission fluid flush 

Note this is not my first time working on a car by any means, and all the parts i’m buying are genuine BMW replacements from ECS Tuning. I also considered doing the water pump to be extra safe, but everything i just mentioned comes out to around $500, and the water pump alone would be over $300 added to that. Let me know if there’s any maintenance i might be missing or any recommendations of work i should do while i’m at it. The cars brakes are good but i will further inspect them when i start working on it.

MPG Digital Readout reading low,"Hi all, new to the sub, longtime 3-series lover. Just got a 2006 325i and wanted to reset everything from the last owner. Not sure if it worked, but I did the throttle reset (key in, floored for 30s, start).

The models I have considered are the 325i 2.5l, the 325i 3.0l, and the 330d, however I am open to any other suggestions! Preferably want to go with a 6 cylinder buy my concern is that if I go for a petrol, I'm gonna get terrible fuel consumption..

My opinion on the E90,"I own a 318d E90 (2011) for about a year now, I purchased it of a dude with full service history and several mechanics confirmed that the car is in great shape. It was driven quite a lot (185k km) but everything looked brand new on it so I bought it. I am driving primarily in urban areas, but I have about 5k kilometers on the open road as well in the past year. I must say, I do have some issues with 'German engineering'. Here's my opinion on it:

Pros:

* Excellent mpg, I get about 6.4 in urban areas and my city has notorious infrastructure with a lot of stopping
* It's one of the nicest looking cars out there (at least for me)
* A perfect balance between firm and soft ride
* Amazing seats, was driving more than 15 hours in 1 direction and didn't feel any back fatigue


Cons:

* Plastic trimming around the windows is bad, I already have 2 trims that need replacing. Not acceptable on a 7 year old german car imo. Was told that the E90 is known for bad trims
* The engine is rather noisy (N47), this bothers me the most I think. I expected a 2011 diesel to run much more smoothly (Yes I know the engine model itself is old but still). I've driven a 318d F30 and the noise is the same, so it's not the mileage that contributes to the sound. There is also the notorious timing chain issue that you need to look out for as it can damage the whole engine if left unattended. My mechanic recommends that I should change it around the 200k interval even if there are no symptoms (noise) because there are a lot of examples of the chain snapping without any (symptoms). His own E90 snapped a chain after 67k kilometers. A friend of mine snapped his while I was driving with him in the car (around 200k), luckily it was  on an uphill so steering and braking wasn't an issue, but he did pay around 3.5k euros in engine repairs
* Cabin sound isolation is also not great, you can really hear the tyres above 100km/h and above 150 talking inside the cabin becomes rather difficult
* The doors don't close properly if not done in a really proper way, tried greasing but the problem still persists
* My left speaker stops working from time to time, was told it's the radio itself, not the speaker
* My harmonic balancer broke and for such a small, simple part it costs a hell of a lot! (400 euros for a 3x20cm metal cylinder)
* I got an error that the driver's door wasn't closed even though I was already driving for 15 minutes and couldn't open the door. Luckily, locking and unlocking all doors allowed me to open the door. Was also told that it's a rather known issue on these cars and that the locks will need changing if it keeps happening.
* I hate that there is no proper space to leave your phone, wallet and keys unless you open the armrest.

So, all in all I would give this car a 6/10 because I expect a lot more quality from a 40k euros car. As a comparison, I own a Mercedes C class from 1995 and a Mitsubishi Colt from 2006 and I had less issues with both those cars in 10 years than I had with this one in 1. Now I am confronted with 2 choices, change the chain since I drive my 1.5y old in it and wouldn't risk anything or try and sell it and get something else, it's a big money drain to be completely honest

I've been dealing with a minor issue for about 8 months now. I've mentioned it to the dealer on two separate (unrelated) visits, but I was unable to reproduce the issue with the shop foreman in the car.

When I accelerate hard past 2300-2400RPM in 1st, 2nd, or 3rd gear, the car sometimes makes a metallic grinding/rubbing noise. It almost sounds like two rotating metal plates touching together briefly. The closest English equivalent would be someone saying ""shhhhhhhit!"" It does not happen every time, and it does not happen when parked.

I can't get a good recording of it. The noise is much louder with the windows open, but the wind noise makes the camera unable to pick up the noise.

Does anyone have any idea what this could be? It has been driving me crazy for so long now, and has made me adjust my driving habits so I don't hear it — and that's no fun.

'11 e90 n55 throwing 0087 code in cold weather - latest code throw says its permanent,"its been gradually getting worse - car stutters during medium/heavy throttle and throws a 0087 code for about ten minutes. it clears up after oil temp fully warms up and I restart car.

research on the code says to check fuel rail pressure at either the pump, the sender/filter, or the fuel pressure sensor itself. 

if anyone has any experience with this - which should I start with? the sender seems easiest to fix, but the internet says most of the 335i problems are the hpfp and should fix that first. Then I read some threads about people replacing both, and still getting symptoms and ended up replacing the sensor.

Annoying whining fan noise,"Hello,
Thank you in advance for any advice/feedback.  I have a 2010 335XI Coupe.  About a month ago I began noticing it has begun to have a high pitching whining noise fan noise while driving.

The problem started coinciding with when the water pump broke and was replaced.  That is likely coincidence, but it may be worth mentioning. 

If someone has had a similar issue and it is not the AC please let me know what it was.

2008 E90 335xi engine died at speed with low (NOT empty) fuel,"I was driving when, at highway speed, I experienced a sudden and complete loss of power. I put in the clutch and the engine speed fell to zero. Trying to restart the engine by popping the clutch failed so I pulled over. Cranking just caused it to crank and crank and crank. Gauge reported 1/8th of a tank, 40 miles to zero on the gauge cluster screen. After 3 minutes I recranked and it fired for about a second then died again. Called a tow truck at this point. After 10 minutes (I was on the shoulder of the express lane, so effectively in the middle of the highway. I was terrified. Sue me) I cranked again. The engine started, it didn't sound rough or anything, so I pressed the accelerator, engine immediately died. Of course, it could have been slightly rough, there was quite a bit of traffic noise.

After a very harrowing hour of being stranded on the express ""shoulder"" of a dark highway in northern New Jersey, a good Samaritan flatbed gave me a tow to a gas station (fucking guy Geico called let me know they were 'on the way' like 30 minutes ago). Filled it with gas and it started up no problem. I was able to drive back to Brooklyn from where I was in Newark without an issue. Didn't feel down on power, sounded fine, but I do have a CEL now.

I bought the car a few weeks ago from my mother who babied this car since it was new. It has had every service on time. 56k miles. Her dealer replaced the spark plugs, belts, and did an oil change right before I picked it up. She sold it to me since she leased a new 3 series after she had a stall on an icey incline and slid into a curb. She thought the insurance was going to total it/was told it would take 2 months to fix. Insurance didn't total it but it did take 2 months to fix. She fucked the suspension on the driver side real good, but that was the only damage if I recall correctly. All of that said, I don't think that was a stall from low engine speed anymore.

Mystery exterior lamp dash light!,"Hello Reddit!

Anytime my car is on but not in motion (in park, or in drive but sitting still, or in reverse sitting still) a dash light goes off, indicating that one of my exterior lamps is out. 

I assume this means the lamp which is out is one which only turns on when the car has come to a stop for some time. The issue is, I know of no such light. I can't find it on the outside of my car and I find it bizzare.

I currently have an '11 335i 4-door M-sport that I love. We have a kid and while this car is tons better than my old Camaro, it can still feel a bit small. 

I came across a used 2011 550i M-sport within the local area for $16.5k. RWD.

I don't know much about the 550i. And I feel like that should tell me not to get this car. On paper it looks great, so why does no one ever mention it?

2008 328i Diagnosing,"Hey folks, looking to get some opinions on the diagnosis here.

I recently had a rather severe oil sludge problem.  Got it all taken care of, but about 24 hours and at least 50 miles later, the check engine light came on.  Didn't feel anything wrong with the car otherwise.

I got it over to a friend's place and onto his reader.  It had a P0012 code tripped.  Did some reading, and found multiple sources that suggested some sludged up or loose VANOS solenoids could be the culprit.  Made sense to me given the recent sludge problem and the lack of any other symptoms besides minimal rough idling.  Plus it was a cheap DIY solution that I could try before spending any real money.

I bought some replacement o-rings/spacers, pulled the solenoids, gave 'em a good cleaning so they were nice and shiny new, and put everything back.  Turned the car on, ran her around a little bit, she sounded fine, and there was no light on.  Success, I thought.

The next day, within the first 5 miles of driving, the check engine light came back on, only this time, it was accompanied by very rough idle, complete with shaking and vibration akin to a severe misfire problem.  RPMs at idle would randomly flux between 500 and 1K.

**So now I'm thinking**...is there something I could have missed or knocked around while cleaning the solenoids to cause this problem?

Alternatively, maybe the solenoids were a red herring and never an issue?  In which case, a P0012 would probably indicate a true problem with my camshaft timing, but specifically any ideas on that?  As in, bad sensor?  Timing chain?  Heck, could that be the red herring and it's actually bad ignition coils?

The possibilities seem a bit too widespread for me to just start buying and replacing parts without attempting to further diagnose.

Any thoughts or ideas on this?

2006 325i 6MT Reverse Lights not working + Cruise control,"Since I've owned the car the reverse lights have not worked and neither has the cruise control. 

I'd like to have both of these operating again. 

Reverse Lights:
Was given the CC-ID: 117
Left reverse bulb out. I swapped both bulb holders and bulbs. It's not the bulbs or anything else. When checking voltage I only get .03 volts for the reverse voltage when in gear. 

The purple and black cable must have a bad side somewhere grounding out. I have repaired the fire loom that goes from the trunk to the car and soldered multiple wires including the brown ground wire. I fear the wire for the reverse lights is deep in the car where I could not see the part that is causing the problem. 
Since both reverse lights are out it must be past the whole trunk entirely. 

I have reset the FRM for the reset counter with tool32 and still the same voltage. 

Clutch switch works and has been tested.
Fuses all good. 
This leads me to the next problem 


Cruise Control:
No error at all on the BC or INPA
When I try to click the cruise on or even do anything with the stalk it is in ""just for looks mode"". 
I've been trying to figure out how to test the stalk in INPA to see if the car is even recognizing it. 
The brake pedal is not being depressed either; the switch is good. 

What makes this even more weird is usually putting the mirror toggle to the left usually tilts the right mirror down; it does not go. Is that also wired with the reverse lights?

Reverse lights out; cruise control won't work

Just want to pass on what I learned (E90 328xi ESS Sensor Issues),"As a quick aside: I was a mechanic in the military for 7 years and the BMW mechanical stuff threw me for a loop.  Below was the journey.    
- I purchased my 328xi in the fall and it was wonderous.    
- One day I went to start the car and it was bucking really bad, throwing the actual CEL, and driving in limp mode.     
- It also started ""howling"" for lack of a better word.  It sounded like it was coming from the belts.  I attempted to rectify the belt/pulley with some spray lubricant.  It was ineffective and in retrospect I feel dumb as shit about that.    
- I took the car in to the local shop (ISA in Colorado Springs) and they diagnosed it as the PCV aka valve cover, ESS Sensor causing fully retarded timing, and overpressure (500mb) of the vacuum system causing the valve cover to intake manifold vacuum line to break.    
- I replaced the vacuum line, ESS Sensor, and Valve Cover w/ Gasket, reset the ECU and reinitialized the Valvetronic Motor and it was perfect after that.    

The first time I replaced the ESS Sensor it was ""better"" but the code for the ESS didn't go away.  Fixing the vacuum line made the new weak point for the overpressure move to the rear main seal and could have caused failure if I hadn't fixed it fast enough.  I had to purchase ANOTHER ESS Sensor and that one worked perfectly.    
Be aware of Amazon sales like this one: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LQ4Y03Q/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

2008 328XI Stutter Turning Right &amp; Accelerating,"Hey guys, just picked up a 2008 328XI coupe with a 6MT. Car has 80k miles. After swimming through various forum posts and reddit posts and being unconvinced on a diagnostic for my problem I've turned to asking the experts in the community.

From being immobile at a stop sign or traffic light, when I initiate a right turn a rubbing / occasional clunk noise may be heard which seems to be coming from the right front side. When turning left I faintly hear the noise and I still believe it to be coming from the right front side. If I am already rolling into the turn and instead stay in neutral, no noises are present. The noise is consistent with every tire rotation, so one rotation will act as if the tire ""rubs"" once on an invisible item. Most of the time the sound is just that, an annoying ""rub"", but occasionally it will clunk once through the turn. 

From what I gather this is either CV joint (which I'm not sure should make noise or not through neutral, but I believe it should still make noise), Transfer case oil or Diff oils. 

I am planning to change the transfer case oil and both diff. oils as I do not have any service record of them being changed previously.

On a severity sound scale I'd say it's maybe a 1-2, just there enough to be felt but not making any substantial crashing noises to where I'm thinking the transfer case is completely shot. 

Tires shouldn't be rubbing, shocks are nearing end of life in front, brakes in front are about 6 months old. In all cases the noises go away when I go around a corner in neutral so I'm believing its transmission / diff related. 

I'm hoping the TCASE and DIFF oils are just so past due that they're not allowing the front diff to slip enough through turns which is why I'm feeling some lock up? I can only find info on X3,X5 owners who have had to replace transfer cases by the hundreds and M3 owners who get the same symptoms in their rear diffs while turning, but not much info on the 328 coupe xdrives.

TL:DR - Intermittent ""rubbing"" and occasional clunk noise when accelerating and turning right mostly but sometimes left. Doesn't make noise when in neutral.

Oil leak? Non certified oil?,"Alright 23 year old here with an 08’ 328i.

So I bought the car with 89K miles last August. Currently at 98K. I do not put a lot of miles on the car. I do take it on some trips every now and then but nothing crazy. Anyways I got my battery and alternator replaced during the summer and on July 25th got an oil change done.

(95,555 miles at oil change currently at 98,000).

The Indy shop I take it to handles a lot of luxury cars, they told me I had a possible rear main seal leak but they advised me to “Monitor it and see if I am losing oil, then take it to BMW if it becomes a problem”

Also they put in Castrol 5W-30 Sythetic oil (DEXOS), which apparently isn’t Bmw certified? I was told by some other bmw guys I know that if you use non certified oil it could become hot and lead to a blown gasket??

I have been monitoring it and just saw today that I am currently at the halfway mark/OK.

I am assuming there is definitely a leak considering they said my next oil change is at 100K miles and I am only at 98K.

Should I buy some oil and put it in then just monitor till I hit 100K miles? Then obviously take it into bmw for an oil change/inspection?

I am trying to hold off until I got a little more cash before I take it in. I know bmw normally cost an arm and a leg. I know they are also the best place to get an inspection done, then maybe if it is a rear main seal leak get a quote from them and other bmw Indy shops?

Here’s some photos from today, pretty sure this is the leak? Didn’t see anything else when I popped the hood or looked underneath the car that could be leaking oil. This is directly underneath the passenger seat side.

E92 335i xdrive Oil Pan Gasket Cost,"My car is a 2009 with 132k miles and my oil pan gasket has started to leak. I have a few questions for those of you who have had this issue.

How much did you pay to have it fixed?
A shop quoted me $2200 so I laughed and walked away. I know this replacement is a bitch and a half, but come on now.

Is this an urgent issue if I can just monitor the oil level and keep it topped off? 
I've driven 2-3k since my last oil change, and the oil level has not moved at all. The oil pan is at the bottom, so I can't imagine the oil is getting onto bad places like it does when the OFHG or VCG start to leak.

Since 95% of the cost here is labor for tearing apart the car, are there other things that I should have serviced while they are in there?

Any insight is appreciated.

E90 Gas mileage problem!!,"Recently my 2006 325i has been acting very strange. My gas mileage calculator was showing an average of 99.9mpg, so I reset it. And also noticed that the estimated fuel range indicator goes down very fast when I first start driving for 10 to 15m (it will go down 20 miles or so even if o only drive 4-5) then it starts going up, sometimes it will even go past the estimated fuel range I started with!  I’m in the process of calculating my actual MPG to see if I’m actually losing MPG. 

I replaced the air filter and cleaned both vanos solenoids. 

Problem still persists.

Suspension Refresh Kit - Has anyone done this?,"Hello,
I am looking at the suspension upgrade kit shown at the bottom of the post.  Has anyone done this to their car?  Originally I was just going to do control arms and maybe coil overs, but then I spent too much time shopping online :).

The description says it is a complete refresh with aftermarket upgrades, but I'm not entirely sure what type of changes I would see.  If I did this I would most likely upgrade to polyurethane bushings as well, since I'm already asking a mechanic to do all of this other work under the car anyway and my car is now 8 years old and approaching 100k miles.

Would this kit make it overly uncomfortable to be a daily driver? I'm kind of new to this developing obsession, so thanks for humoring the dumb questions.

N52 (99k kilometers) metallic rattle sound sometimes between 2-3k rpm?,"Took it back to the used car dealer i got it from and he said it's the valvetronic/vanos adjusting and is a normal sound.. I know he's talking shit about it being normal so I took it to my European specialist mechanic. 
I didn't want him to look into it too much because I'm going to get the dealer to pay/fix it so he didn't check sparkplugs or coils/fuel etc. 
My mechanic thinks the engine is pinging and requires an ecu update for lower octane fuel (I currently use BP 98 octane and had no issues with my last N52 in New Zealand so) I gave an octane booster a try but it didn't change anything. Am sceptical about it being a fuel issue, perhaps carbon buildup? Vanos wearing out and rattling?(does that still happen on N52s? I knew it was common on older engines.. Vanos Solenoids/check valves? 

Any ideas? Has anyone else had a similar metallic rattle/sound (sort of like the marbles in a can but higher pitch) only happens between 2-3k rpm about 30 percent of the time, mostly only during acceleration and for a half second as I let go of the gas.

Am getting slightly lower fuel economy than expected and it will occasionally bog and be very slow when I take off from a stop. 

Have just had my transmission fluid/filter changed and also engine oil so it shouldn't be a low/old fluid issue. Perhaps rattly timing chain or tensioner? 

I understand reddit computer chair mechanics won't be able to diagnose my issue perfectly with my shoddy description but I have tried my best to explain and am just looking at ideas to look into with my mechanics, otherwise I will try getting an official BMW workshop to diagnose what's wrong.

JB4 question: mods vs. map compatibility. Hoping the crowd has a consensus and experience to offer...,"New subscriber here-

Writing to appeal to the hive mind with a question of good idea/bad idea: 

I've got a 335is which has the N54 motor. It has the BMS dual cone intake, upgraded intercooler and charge pipe, upgraded diverter valves, and I've deleted the SECONDARY cats. I've also read that the 335is comes from the factory with a performance-type exhaust, (but I don't know how much the backpressure is actually reduced vs. stock non-is exhaust).

I usually roll around with map 5 calling the shots as it sees fit. My question is: Is map 2 safe to run long-term with my setup given that I do NOT have upgraded cats or catless downpipes?

I don't want to get non-stock cats because they're expensive nor do I want to outright delete them and run the risk of flunking emissions etc etc.

I have a steady supply of good 93 octane fuel available in TN.

I've already asked BMS directly but want to cast a wider net before I make any changes.

‘11 335i Filling up with oil smoke,"I started experiencing a burning candle smell about a month ago. Two or so weeks after that I was on an incline and the entire cabin and engine bay was filled with oil smoke. I had lost about a quart of oil in a week.

I replaced the valve cover gasket and found lots of coagulated oil on the back left of the valve cover. It was obvious oil had been leaking onto the exhaust manifold when on an incline.

Today, it happened again. Smoke filling the cabin and engine bay when on an incline.

Any ideas? I could have repaired it wrong, but a gasket change is pretty simple. Could it be excess oil from when it was leaking? I’ve put about 200 mi on the car since I replaced the gasket.

After market stereo,"I have heard that it is kind of a pain in the ass to do, but my stereo system pretty much doesn’t work. The back light works, but there is no display. Also some times it only gets three channels and won’t get more until the car is restarted. Basically I just want a new stereo. I bought a JVC stereo and a kit that has the harness, antenna adaptor, and face plate. I have read somewhere that you have to run a new wire to the battery, I read in another place the wire is to the amp, and I have seen a video where a guy just plugs it in and it works (though the wire harness looked much more complicated than mine). I figured I would just give it a shot as is. When sotering the two parts of the harness together there is one blue wire that can either attach to a blue and white wire or a blue and yellow wire. When I did this for my e46 the solid blue had to go to the wire marked “remote control” I think it was blue and yellow or else it would not make any sound, but would still light up. I put it all together and it wouldn’t turn on or light up. Has anyone done this before? Any help would be greatly appreciated.  ",E90,1514162600,Heyoteyo,0,1,True,2017-12-24

The N54 in my 335i seized yesterday on the way home from the mechanic.,"Basically what the title says.  I took my 2010 E90 335i with 80,500 miles to a local indie shop on Wednesday, to have the following work done: install KW coilovers, alignment, replace leaking oil filter housing, walnut blast intake valves and replace spark plugs.

Yesterday I pick it up and less than 10 minutes after leaving the shop, my tach dropped to 0 RPM, I lost power steering and pulled over.  Pressing the start button resulted in a single click.

I got it towed back to the shop that had just serviced it, and this morning they call to tell me the engine won't turn over.

They say they have no idea why it happened, and are blaming the 30% E85 blend with 91 in my fuel tank, saying the E85 didn't lubricate the piston.  I thought lubricating the piston was the oils job??
