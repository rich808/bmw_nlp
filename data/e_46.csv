HID Ballast Question (Self Leveling and Cornering Headlights),"Hi all, I am in the process of fixing every little thing broken on my e46 and have gotten down to a headlight problem I've had for a while now. About a year ago, after heavy rain, my driver side HID went out. I realized that water had gotten on the computer for it and had killed it. BMW wanted $1,600 to fix it but I just found a replacement module on eBay for $60. The light works fine now but it no longer self levels or corners with the wheels. The little LED on the LCM constantly flashes too. Does anyone know of any way of potentially flashing this new computer to make the self leveling work again?",e46,1582147313,enm22,4,1,True,2020-02-19

Weird Intermittent Temperature Problem,"Hey, I was wondering if anyone else had experienced a similar issues, I looked over at the E46Fanatics forum but couldn't find anyone with a similar issue.

This only happened 2 days ago. When I'm driving intermittent, I find usually after I hit a bump my temperature gauge will go all the way cold, and then slowly climb back up to operating temperature. Sometimes though it'll go slightly over operating temperature like it's overheating but it doesn't reset itself like it does when it goes cold. 

I don't want to drive my car in case it really is overheating, though I think it's just the temperature sensor. Seems to happen only when idling for a minute or so.

My theory is that the temperature sensor went bad, and isn't allowing the auxiliary fan to kick on when idling because it thinks the engine is cold, causing it to actually overheat. I really have no idea, but I'm a broke student so I don't want to go changing things willy nilly.

Auxiliary fan was just replaced by my mechanic with a used one, and so was the thermostat (Not sure if it's new or used).

I currently own a '03 330xi w/180k miles, possibly looking to make that my winter car since it has AWD and to hopefully prolong it's life a little. So I've been looking at non-AWD e46s for summer driving and found this nice '01 330ci with only 70k miles.

It's at a bmw dealership right down the road, I test drove it yesterday and it is a very clean and well maintained car. Only had 1 previous owner who put less than like 3k a year on it.

That being said, it's due for all the common e46 problems around 70k-100k miles which I don't think anything was done for preventative maintenance. And in my opinion the price is quite high, KBB puts it around $3.9-5k adjusted for the low mileage. Dealer has their price listed around $8,800 which seems quite high.

Thing looks great in person. But when I asked about a PPI, the guy said they'd be getting one at a dealer soon. It felt like a good way to deflect from an independent PPI that I'm very much insistent on getting. But I have to wonder, though, would a dealer still give a reputable inspection? Everything else seems nice (yeah I know SMG isn't popular, but I'm willing to manual swap one if it grenades). Good condition car with lower mileage than a lot of others I've seen, with the consequently higher price. It's just this one red flag that's turning me off bigtime.

Double din system selection advice,"Hi folks,

I'm happy with my rig, it's awesome piece of car and a lot better then my brand new Seat Leon I had before.
But the only problem is in soundsystem that seems to be some Chinese piece of crap that looks like BMW vanilla system (I mean original one from the factory) but it's impossible to understand logic of its 90s looking interface and it sounds like blue whale ass sounds which doesn't fit Harman cardon kit at all.

So it's too obvious I want to replace it with smth good and modern.
I read through a lot of forums but there tons of chinese systems that I think will sound equally poorly and threads are outdated cause as we know technologies now change everyday.

I'll really appreciate if you can advice some modern android auto fueled systems because I can't live wo my Google music playlists :)

And does E46 specific 2din placeholders fits for all systems that is not design as BMW vanilla one? 
Or does it require some cut job if I'll buy placeholder from AliExpress? My mate is sure it standard for all 2din systems and no cut required.

On brakes and idling (yes),"I've owned my 2004 e46 316i for about 3 years now and driven it with great pleasure. It's had its hiccups, but running it has required much less than the $5k a year I hear people use a lot, so I count myself lucky. I got it at 171k KM, it has about 210k KM on the clock now and it's still a great drive.

It has an oil leak (valve cover gasket), slightly leaky heater core, not all the flapper motors work anymore. Recently I had my brake pedal go hard and a ""brake pressure sensor 2 pressure unlikely"" popped up after reading it.  Now a little bit of back story.

My brakes had always functioned well, but since I've had it, before I started the car, the brake pedal would be a little hard. I've had other brands of cars do this, some from the factory, so I didn't pay any attention to it. But I was also never able to get the idle speed at 650 RPM, it always was (roughly) at 900.

So last week happens, brake pedal goes hard again, now intermittently. I take it to the shop, and they diagnose a faulty brake booster. The mechanic explained to me that the brake booster maintains vacuum pressure to keep your brakes from going hard when the engine is off. The brake vacuum system apparently is tied to the crankcase vacuum and has an extra pump as a boost. The brake sensors, just tend to break, he told me, but since they were opening it up, might as well replace both.

I give the go-ahead to replace the brake pressure sensors, brake booster, one-way valve, and some lines. A $1200 job that they completed very quickly. The tech informed me that there was a second-hand brake booster in there, so the previous owner had already replaced it. The garage also cleaned out the vacuum pump because it had filled with oil (presumably because of the leaky brake booster sucking in air and oil constantly).

After they replaced those parts, my car suddenly started idling at 650RPM, so I assume that the brake booster had a massive effect on idling, comparable to taking the oil cap off while running.

Now here's the thing. I've looked in numerous places, and I can't find many accounts of the brake booster failing on an e46. I'm a little worried that I've now replaced the booster, but there is a root cause that I'm missing, that will make this one fail in time too. The previous owner had already replaced it, albeit with a second-hand part, before 170k KM.

Might there be a root cause that I'm missing, or am I worrying over nothing? Also thanks to the guys at Garage Wilgenlaan in Berkel en Roderijs, NL for handling this quickly and neatly.",e46,1583318157,DracarysMeansFire,2,1,True,2020-03-04

[See, such vehicular beauty](https://preview.redd.it/cghj6u3s7ql41.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3c9d07de97712498af78720844cc582010fdfcd)

The whole point of buying this car is to race it. Me and some friends have been driving in a ""24hr of Lemons""-like series for a few years here in Sweden, and in the past we have been racing Mazda 323 (BG) or Volvo V40's in several 24h and a couple 8h races. Due to some changes in technical regulations and the fact that the old car just needed to be put down after long and faithful service, we now decided to switch to a M54B22-powered E46. The series allow for 2200cc NA (or 1800cc with forced induction), and we wanted something reasonably sporty and RWD that is easy to find cheap parts for, and this fits the bill nicely.

Another part of the regulations is that they allow maximum 205 wide tires, mostly to keep the speed down and promote smaller cars. Given the availability of tires we like (need to be the right balance of grippy and durable), this makes 16"" wheels the most appealing size. Which brings me to the topic of brakes. We'd like to go with bigger brakes if possible, not primarily for the extra braking power (which will be of limited use on 205's) but because larger rotors will be not as warm for the same ""braking energy"", the larger pads having more material in them and would last longer, and there being a bigger selection of racing pads for the ""sportier"" E46 models. Of course there are full aftermarket brake kits available, but we're somewhat cheap and don't want to spend that kind of money unless necessary. A ""stock parts"" upgrade would be a lot cheaper to do.

The car has stock 320i brakes, and currently sits on 15"" wheels. From what I can gather, 316/318/320 has small enough brakes that they fit in 15"" wheels (not sure if they all are the same size brakes), 323/325/328 being slightly larger needing 16"", and 330 being the largest requiring 17"" wheels. Lots of people stick 330 brakes in ""smaller"" E46'es, but other kinds cross-compatibility I don't find much documentation about.  
Upgraded rear brakes might be even more useful than fronts. All regular cars tend to have a lot of front brake bias (to keep them braking ""nicely"" under all weather conditions), and we'd probably want it a bit further back. The fronts are what usually wear out (even high-temp racing pads often wear out before the end of a 24h race), and more braking in rear would help that(as well as making car a bit easier to get to turn into corners.

So, I have questions!

* What model has the biggest size brakes that will fit in a 16"" wheel on an E46? Same for both front and rear? Quick looks at parts shops suggests 325 has larger size front rotors than 320, but same rear, but what do I know.
* For such an upgrade, what parts do we need to replace? Rotors and pads of course. Calipers and caliper brackets I'm assuming? How about brake shields? Any other stuff?
* What does it take to make the parking brake work with larger rotors? Just bigger shoes, or more parts?

"330i P0301, P0305, P0300 After Frozen CCV Replacement","My CCV froze, and the valve cover gasket blew near the Secondary Air Pump. Spark plugs from Cylinders 1, 2, and 5 were very oily, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

I bought an M56 valve cover, but shipping was slow, so the car sat for a month.

&amp;#x200B;

I just finished the install, and I fired it up, and the tailpipe spewed white smoke and the first 02 sensor on bank one was smoking, too.

&amp;#x200B;

I let it burn off, and I took it around the block. 1/2 a block later, I got a CEL: P0301, P0305, and P0300.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned it off, and I cleared the CEL, assuming that it would reappear, and I could start troubleshooting plugs and coils.

&amp;#x200B;

I turned it back on, and after five minutes of idle, there was no CEL.

&amp;#x200B;

Could the cylinders have been fouled with oil from the CCV's freezing, and bringing it up to temperature sorted it?

&amp;#x200B;

I'll take it around the block again tomorrow, and if it comes back, I believe the best procedure is to swap the questionable coil to a known good coil and see if the misfire travels, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

Can the coil procedure be repeated with plugs, as well? 

&amp;#x200B;

If I can't find an error in ignition, can I move around the injectors in the same manner to check for fueling errors?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm rattling my brain, trying to think of things I may have done wrong, and short of reusing 12 month old plugs, putting on too much silicone grease on the coils (I did use SylGlide instead of dielectric grease this time), or not wobbling the fuel rail fully into place (wouldn't it be leaking fuel?), I can't think of much.",e46,1584321416,D0gDay,14,1,True,2020-03-15

"325i Running rich - Out of ideas, help? Long post, but I would really appreciate any and all input.","tldr first - 2002 325i - Codes P1083 and P1085. Car has secondary air pump delete, not sure if the ecu was adjusted after that. Other than that, can't find a vacuum leak, but it idles rough and smells like it's running rich. One of those codes mentioned a fuel sensor, can't seem to find anything about that online.

&amp;#x200B;

So a few weeks ago I bought a 325i. It's pretty much a drift car. It apparently has been swapped to another MB54, not sure what happened to the first. Not positive if it even is the MB54 or not, I have yet to get underneath it and check.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that it definitely smells like it's running rich, and it also does smell very strong like gas like all the time. I don't think there's a leak, honestly the guy who swapped it a few owners ago never even put the microfilter housing back on it, so I'm assuming that's at least part of the reason why it smells so strong, is because there's literally no microfilter which is just the cabin air filter on these, right? The only reason I'm not convinced that putting a new housing/filter on will fix it is because it smells pretty strong like gas from the outside too so I'm just not sure. 

The car is throwing P1083 and P1085 codes.

Other than the gas smell, it's definitely smelling like it's running rich. I changed the valve cover gasket, spark plugs, and did an oil change. Everything looked pretty good, the gasket was just a little funky in one spot, but honestly seemed like it was replaced recently anyways. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's a secondary air pump delete with the plate on it, but I'm not sure if the ECU was ever programmed accordingly afterwards.  I know you're supposed to disable it. Not sure if that would cause the rich smell, the gas smell, or the codes. Only thing I've seen is that the codes it's throwing are something to do with a fuel sensor but can't find much about it online. 

&amp;#x200B;

I looked at my carfax and there is no indication that it has been done but when I search my VIN online the only recall that says needs to be done is the airbags I stated above. Do you think when I schedule my recall for the airbags, my dealership will tell me if the connecting rod recall has been done or is there no way for them to know?

Should I keep it or not?,"Hello my FriE46s 

I own a 2000 E46 (323i) Sedan, and it’s now third car in home, we have a 2016 Ford Explorer as the family car and a 2012 Mustang V6 which is my daily driver.
I have been taking good care of the E46, today it only has 75,000 miles, but I have been wondering if I may sell it as-is or put some money on it to make it shine again, a few cosmetic parts need replacement, the paint job and the front seats need to be renewed.

There is no much value selling it but if I spend the money to make it look great there is no way I can get that money back either, and surely I have been taking good care of it, no too many miles for a 20 years old car, but I’m afraid it star asking me for big repairs any time soon .

I like the car, but owning three cars is expensive and I’m conscious it doesn’t have collection value since it’s not a M3, yet I love the design and how nice it drives.

Farewell to my beloved,"It all started with my e36. I fell in love. Then, years later, with the e46 I fell even more in love.

Today marks the end of an era, my final day with my e46. I sold her. My BLK 2001 325i. My love. At first I was skeptical, she wasn't as appealing as my 1997 328i. But that changed.

When I bought her, I had Christmas tree dash-lights, as we do. What to do first?

Spark plugs? No?
Coils...
Valve Cover Gasket?... Ok, the entire Valve Cover
Fuel Pump... err .. a second time since it didn't take the first time
Water Pump...
All pullies...
A/C unit...
New alternator
Sweet, free horsepower, replace stock fan with electric fan...
Bad wiring? Redo... everything..?
Bad brake lights? Fix it poorly 20 times...
Broken window motors... I'm an expert now
Door lock ... err.. that's stayed broken, pain in the ass.
Power Steering Pump &amp; Reservoir...
New hoses on everything
New CVV, oil separator...
New intake boots
New throttle body
Cold Air Filter (Sweet! Everyone should do this, makes car sound way better)
New washer pumps and nozzles
New Speakers
New battery
New tires
New Everything else that matters.. filters, transmission, fluid, etc

I'll never forget the miracle she provided, in between other repairs I couldn't afford - she's flashing codes, as she does, and my smog inspection is due. How will I ever clear my codes and get an inspection? I tried every trick in the book. By some kind of grace of God, she cleared codes, and passed smog, by some miracle. As I drove away from the smog lot, she popped lights not 2 miles away. I can't believe it. She saved me a lot of money by giving me that miracle, at a time I had none.

And today, on the day I sell her, only the yellow DSC and yellow brake light remain on. My blood, sweat and tears are all over this car. I've sworn and cursed at this car more than any other. I put way too much time and money into it, but don't regret it. I'm leaving this relationship on a high note, not a low one. Everything is running perfectly, and has now for some time. I've worked years to get this car into it's proper state. Now, selling the car at a MAJOR loss, let's just say, I'm basically giving this car away. It's confusing that I'm selling it at this time, the only time it doesn't cause me stress. Maybe that's part of my problem in general. But here we are.

"Possibly Selling My 2004 330XI, Automatic, 197k miles, New Jersey","Hey guys, this is a sad post but I might be putting up my E46 for sale. I would only want to her to go to a good home and just putting this out there to see if there is any interest. I'm not sure whether I will keep her as a backup/weekend car or sell her. She's in great shape in many ways, but also at 200k there are many items that will need to be replaced in the next year or 2 if I keep driving her everyday which is 15-17k miles a year for me. The positives: I've treated her like a queen with lots of maintenance, but of course I haven't done everything. Things I can think of off the top of my head that will need to be replaced in the next 50k miles or so.... alternator, fuel pump, cooling system, motor mounts. The cooling system was refreshed at around 130-140k miles. In the last few years I have refreshed the transmission, differential, transfer case, and brake fluids. I added a carbon fiber front strut brace in the engine bay, added depo clear/light smoke side headlight lens/markers and also added white IJDMtoy led day time running lights that are code free. The car has 2 sets of wheels/tires, 1 set are 16 inch Michelin x-ice snow tires and the other set are 17 inch Michelin pilot sport 2 all seasons with 1 full 17 inch spare with a continental tire on that and both are BMW wheels. Tires are in good shape with another season or 2 left on both sets. In recent years I have replaced CCV, valve cover gaskets, oil filter housing gasket, spark plugs, cleaned DISA valve with new o-ring, new front control arms, new steering coupler, front &amp; rear brakes plus new front left caliper, new serpentine belt and tensioner/pulley, rear shocks, new hood cable, AC refresh this past summer, new front driveshafts, new center driveshaft &amp; center support bearing &amp; flex disc and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head.

The car drives perfect normally but randomly when stationary, at a light for example, the car will lose rpm and shift into limp mode.

Taken to mechanics, of course they suggest new transmission but im inclined to replace the sensor and refresh the fluids.

Total Cost of a CEL-free Catless Header Install,"I'm pricing out a 330i catless header install.

[400 for BimmerBrakes SS V1.](http://www.europartsonline.com/bimmerbrakes-ss-m54b25-m54b30-v1-performance-headers/)

[Exhaust flange gaskets are 7 a piece, so 14](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/bmw-catalytic-converter-gasket-18107502346).

[Exhaust manifold heat shield gaskets are 17 a piece, so 34.](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-victor-reinz-parts/exhaust-manifold-gasket-with-heat-shield-priced-each/11621732969~vic/)

[24 exhaust manifold nuts](https://www.autohausaz.com/pn/11721437202) for .70, so 17.

4 exhaust flange bolts, m10x1.5 by 40mm. I'm not spending 16 dollars for an inconel bolt that'll rust up in a month, so I'll just get an anodized one for a dollar each, so 4. If you want the OE, part number is 11621427586.

4 exhaust flange nuts; the part for BMW is 18301737774, but [you can use the VOLVO part to save some dough!](https://www.fcpeuro.com/products/volvo-exhaust-flange-nut-header-pipe-10mm-977211) .47 each, so 2.

Now, a tune.  I believe most tuners are ""sharing"" the same tune. Depending on which forum you read, someone stole it, but it's he-said-she-said. Also, the Shark Injector is known to be garbage since Turner purchased it. Therefore, if you want a CEL-free tune from running catless headers, the cheapest, yet positively reviewed tune, is 404 dollars. You can try O2 extenders, defoulers, etc., but I think a tune is a better option, as it deletes the code, and, perhaps, aligns parameters to get more out of that freer-flowing exhaust.

Total price: 191 for eBay headers or 467 for BimmerBrakes SS V1. I'd prefer the BimmerBrakes, as I'm an amateur welder at best. I won't wrap them, as I live in an area with salted roads, so there's a local shop that will do ceramic coating for 150 dollars. **If I add in the tune, I'm looking at 745 with tune and coating or 1021 for BimmerBrakes headers with tune and coating.** I'll go with the BimmerBrakes because at 745 for eBay, I might as well go all in.

The trunk's keyhole will lock-out if turned horizontally. It will permit the dash and trunk releases if turned vertically.

I've opened up the ""elephant trunk"" loom. There weren't any visibly damaged wires. I traced from their entry into the boot lid all the way to where they join the main loom. However, I think the key's remote release and the trunk-mounted release share the same wires, so if the trunk-release is working, the key should work.

I tested the key at an automotive store, and each button is transmitting a signal. This is to prove the key isn't malfunctioning.

I checked fuses 49, 52, and 60. No damage. They're the only fuses related to the trunk release that I could find.

Upon pressing the unlock button on the keys, the lights turn on immediately, and the driver door unlocks. A second press unlocks all doors. Upon pressing lock, the doors lock instantly, and the lights fade out after ten seconds. These tests are to prove the GM5 isn't malfunctioning.

I've read there is no relay for the trunk release's connector to the GM5 (MERHK, connector X253, pin 17).

In a week, I'll have a new key, as that's my last best guess of a a failure point. Either way, I need a new key, so no big deal there.

Mystery coolant leak,"So yesterday I pull into work's car-park and I step out my car. I walk over to the passenger side (left hand in my country) and I notice a trail of water coming from the bottom of my car. On closer inspection it's coolant... and there's a lot of it.

I pop the hood and the coolant is smoking. I can't see where the coolant is coming out of, I get back inside the car and check the temperature. The needle is still in the middle, phew.

The car's too hot for me to touch anything so I go to work and return 8 hours later. The engine has cooled down, and now the coolant light is on. I top up the expansion tank with over a litre of water and run the engine. I leave it running for a bit, but no leaks.

I decide to drive the car back home for about 30 minutes while keeping an eye on the temperature gauge. I get home, look under the car, no leak.

I jack the car up, take the engine cover off, run the engine and peek under. I let it run for a while, but still no leak.

Does anyone have any idea where the leak could have come from?

I replaced the expansion tank about 2500kms ago too.",e46,1579265833,spacecowboy77453,2,1,True,2020-01-17

E46 Race Build,"Ok, so for the last 4 year I have been racing an E36 with a few friends in one of the crapcan endurance series. Unfortunately this year we aren't able to race for various reasons. One of which being we'd need to put 1.5K into the current car to get it to our standard (we like running for first overall, not in a lower class).

Why does that bring you to the E46 sub? you ask?

Well, we are going to sell the current car and build an E46 sedan and plop in a 3L.

Now, I know some of you have prepped these cars before and really, I'm wondering what would you recommend?

Our list of wants for the car is for it to be reliable for up to 30 hours of continuous racing as the biggest concern. We are also big fans of out braking spec Miata's like we currently are (praise be to PFC pads). For power, we are probably around the 230HP mark currently (we have the m50 intake on an m52b28 along with a standalone ecu and some other slight reworkings) so the E46 should make more than enough HP without going crazy.

We don't have a LSD yet, and thats a point of contention right now as we will be giving up our old collection (goodbye hard to find 3.4's), and I think, but am not sure, that our old transmissions will bolt up? correct me if I'm wrong.

We plan on doing the usual stuff, reinforce the subframe, put the cage into the major structural points, put it on a diet... yada yada yada.

Is there anything you guys would recommend do? don't do? parts you really like and would recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

Touring rear springs on sedan?,"My fiance's car (2002 325xi Sedan) has a broken rear coil spring. I just picked up a set of H&amp;R springs for my car (2001 325xi Touring).

I think there fronts are the same, the rears being different rates because of how the Touring carries it's additional 160lbs. She probably has enough junk in her trunk to offset the difference anyway. :)

I'm figuring worst case, her car sits a bit higher in the rear... Probably not noticably higher... But I can't imagine any serious issues beyond that, am I wrong?

Can I run the new amplifier to the terminals under the hood instead? I'm aware that the amp fuse needs to be as close to the battery as possible, but I've never had remote terminals, so I don't know.

Eonon Headunit draining battery,"So I recently found out my Eonon head unit is draining my cars battery. I picked it up in august when I was driving the car every day, multiple times a day and I thought everything was fine. I replaced the battery at some point in October because the car was dead after 5 days of not driving, I assumed then it was the battery and just swapped it. Fast forward to December.

I let my car sit for a week and when I went out to start it, it was dead. I knew the battery was fine. This happened on January 2nd, I originally thought it was the obd2 bluetooth adapter I kept hooked up to the car but that was not it. 

I ran a proper parasitic draw test, came back after 16 minutes to get a reading of .338A way too high. 

Popped out radio fuses 7 and 41, redid the test, after 16 minutes this time I got .019A, that was more like it. Clearly the radio is drawing power when it shouldn't be but I'm stumped as to where I should go from here. 

I've found a bunch of mods online that people have done to other off branded android units to try to fix it but I figured I'd post here to see if anyone has had the same issue or a similar issue. Anyone with experience please comment lol.

Also my model of the headhunt is the Eonon Ga9150B, its a px5 model with 4gb of ram. I've seen other people that have off branded px5 head units with 4gb of ram that also drain from the battery.

'04 330Ci w/ Strange Tail Light/Electrical Issue,"Just picked up this '04 330Ci with super low miles. It came with this strange electrical issue. The driver side tail light will perform all functions, but the brake light won't increase intensity. I believe the tail lights are OEM. I know the fuse is fine since the brake lights aren't stuck on. Could it be coding related? I left the housing unplugged with the car in accessory mode and it didn't throw a fault, so maybe that was disabled? The wiring looks fine at the tail light, and no pins are rusted. Not sure if this is related, but my cruise control also doesn't work despite the fuse also being okay. I was thinking brake switch on the pedal, but it's working fine when I apply the brake. Thanks for any insights!

Quick release on a stock 3 spoke steering wheel,"So i was looking for a quick release for the stock steering wheel for my car for a few reasons: 1) easier to get in and out of (im on the taller end and its sometimes a lil difficult to drop in and get out with out hitting my thigh on the steering wheel) and 2) it would move it closer to me, (again, tall, have the steering wheel all the way out, but it still feels like i have to reach for it cause i have the seat so far back to accommodate my legs). It’s pretty much accepted for cars with quick releases to only have a horn button but that seems a little strange to me cause im into sim racing too, and you can switch those wheels out with a quick release and they have all of the buttons for an xbox controller too, without being horrifically expensive. I don’t want to lose the skip and volume stuff along with cruise, but i also would like the benefits of something like a quick release, and i feel like that should be totally plausible.",e46,1580428430,theminthawk,3,1,True,2020-01-30

Diamond keys are strong...,"This morning, I left my apartment to leave something in my car on the way to the subway. 
 
As I was getting into the elevator, my diamond key slipped out of my hand &amp; fell directly down the elevator shaft - 22 floors up. My heart sunk, and I just thought to myself ""Cool $170 down the shaft...""
 
To my absolute luck, they're doing maintenance on the elevators in my building, and there happened to be an elevator repair man loading gear in. He agreed to go look quick for it in the shaft.
 
2 minutes later, he emerged with a slightly bent diamond key, with no other damage. No splitting into 100000 pieces or anything.
 
Went out to the car, all functions still work, car stars and all. Bent the key back straight (which took some force and patience to also not split the plastic), and the key is all good.

E46 Suspension Refresh - Non-Sport to Sport Conversion?,"Hi all,

My 2005 325i sedan is at around 110,000 miles on its original suspension, and I'm taking her in to get a refresh. Since I've owned it, the front suspension (control arms/bushings, tie rods, sway bar connectors) have all been replaced, but nothing on the rear.

I'm planning on having the front shocks, rear struts, and the trailing arm bushing replace. My car is an automatic, non-sport sedan. I don't commute with it anymore (bicycle to work FTW), but love taking it on road trips in SoCal, usually with girlfriend and dog. I'm a ""spirited"" driver, but nothing more, and usually drive like a grandma when my girlfriend and dog are in the car. When I really want to have fun/be dangerous, I ride a motorcycle. 

I'm planning on replacing the suspension with normal non-sport components (Bilstein B4 shocks). But since I'm replacing it, does it make sense to buy a cheap set of ""sport"" springs and replace everything with the ""sport"" shocks? Again, it is mostly a cruiser, and an automatic at that, but I've never driven the sport models before. If the difference in driving enjoyment is larger than the reduction in driving comfort, I'm tempted to put better suspension in there. 

Asking for collective wisdom; does it make sense upgrading to a ""sport"" package, or just leave it as a non-sport car, with fresh suspension, and keep it as a highway cruiser and future-classic?",e46,1580507948,greyvagabond,7,1,True,2020-01-31

Brothers 2004 325i - 3 somewhat minor issues.,"Brother passed away in November and I inherited his BMW. He had done a lot of work on it himself, but there are things he never got around to that I would like to finish. 

1. Side mirrors have a mind of their own. often going all the way to the right and sitting there clicking. using the switch would cause the mirror to just keep going in that direction indefinitely. This happens to both sides, which indicates to me that it isn't the individual motors.
2. Battery drain. Just replaced battery, and is already causing problems with it getting too low to start. I checked amperage, and keep getting intermittent pulses that may be the cause.
3. warning lights for both headlights and both taillights are always on. All lights work fine though.

He had also bought a complete performance brake kit That I will be installing soon. I'd like to get a few pointers on where to look. My brother was ASE certified and knew much more than I did about this car. All of my experience has been with pre ODBII vehicles along with distributors and carbureted vehicles.

"My 325ci just got totaled by a stopsign runner. Guess I'm in the market for another, possibly an M3. Any tips/buyer guides?","My 325ci that I've had for a few years just got annihilated by a stopsign runner yesterday. The damage is mostly around the passenger rear quarter panel, and is totally fine functionally, but the passenger side is completely busted and the quoted cost to repair it is well over the value of the car. I'm not too keen on continuing with it - it just looks awful, and I'm expecting my insurance to consider it totaled given the repair estimate, so here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering upgrading to an e46 M3. My car had the sport package and was just all-around fun, and I really enjoyed taking it up and around windy roads and whatnot, so I'm thinking an e46 M3 might be a good direction after this. I just love the generation. The higher maintenance of my e46 was manageable for me, and I was/am willing to do necessary updates.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I'm wondering just what I should be looking for and expect in an M3 at this point. In my research, I've heard various things about maintenance, some of which are probably now dated in the year 2020. And to be honest, I don't trust my sense with these things, as this will be only my second car I've ever purchased.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess what I'm asking here is, what should I watch out for? What price range can I find a decent M3 in? I've heard that $10k-$20k is a good range, but is that still true now? And again, I'm pretty okay with the maintenance costs of e46s - I did own one for a few years and now I want another! A couple thousand a year would be okay with me (it has been haha). Should I trust the automatic SMGs? Or if it fails, will it be catastrophic (i.e. I'd be fine swapping to manual if it goes south at some point, but if it blows then write the car off)? Are the other concerns similar (e.g. VANOS, rods, etc.)? I'm thinking the subframe issues would need an immediate fix after purchase, but is there anything to know outside of that? How many miles would it take to be just not worth it (assuming it's even decently maintained)? How much should I focus on a lower mileage car?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text. I'm still continuing to do my research, so I may find answers soon, though it is a little tough with the dated advice I've found. Thanks and godspeed to everyone who's read to this point. I'm super excited to stay in the e46 family, and while the loss of my current daily driver is bitter, perhaps my next steps will be pretty sweet.",e46,1581049586,xristaforante,4,1,True,2020-02-06

Gear shift froze up! Help!,"So I have a 2005 Ci ('vert) sport package with the 6-speed, 112K miles. It's been meticulously cared for and just two owners. Yesterday I was driving to breakfast, just routine driving on a rural highway, when it suddenly refused to shift into gear. 

I put on the hazards, pushed in the clutch and pulled over. I jiggled the gearshift, doing that is-it-in-neutral thing, and it wouldn't move. It was frozen in place. Thinking it was frozen in neutral, I let out the clutch . .. and it stalled.

Turns out that even though the shifter was in the neutral position (yet NOT jiggling; it hardly moved at all), it was in second gear. Weirdly, it WOULD shift in 5th just fine, but it wouldn't go into first or second or third (didn't try 4th or 6th). 

So I kept the hazards on and limped home in 2nd.

Then, I pull into the garage and suddenly it was going into gear like normal again. 

So I'm panicking that it's my clutch or tranny, but my friend suggested that it was the shifter linkage.

I'm panicking additionally because I live in a town that does not have one single German car repair shop. Closest is three hours away, and MY mechanic, the one I know and trust, is SEVEN hours away.

My winter tires are still good (thread depth about 4mm) , so I'd like to keep them. This severely limits what wheels are available to me since the tires are sized 195/65 R15.

Now, I've googled around and found that I should go with 6.5Jx15 ET42.

Is it possible to fit my winter (195/65 R15) tires onto 7Jx16 ET47?

I'm totally new to the wheel/tire dynamics and I'd like to avoid getting the wrong wheels for the tires I already have.

Why does my alternator keep going bad?,"A few months ago I installed two amps, one for sub one for speakers, and it was a Bosch 120 amp. I started having problems and my car kept dying so I replaced the battery and the alternator with another 120 amp Bosch. I was still having problems so I figured I needed a higher output alternator so I got a 150 amp that came out of a e46 convertible. I disconnected my subs and everything drawing power but I’m still having problems and my battery light is flashing or solid whenever I drive. It’s died on my once already. While the car is on I’m getting a reading of about 12 volts. With the car off the battery is reading okay so it isn’t the battery. I know the alternator I got is good and this is the third alternator I’ve installed in the past 6 months. What could be causing this?

Power steering delete,"2001 325xi Touring

My PS pump took a dump and instead of dealing with the noise I removed it until I could order the parts to overhaul the system.

IMO, the steering never had enough feedback so instead of ordering all the parts, I fabricated a delete plate similar to those offered by Garagistic and Condor. And I don't hate it, but it's still a bit more effort than I'd like. 

My S13 has a Miata-style depowered rack (disassemble/remove center seal/grease shaft/reassemble) and I like it. Nissan racks are a dime a dozen, the cheapest XI rack I've found is about $200, so I've been trying to avoid making any irreversible changes.

I’m sorry to the purists,"TLDR: read “my story,” an e46 build channel plug and an obligatory pic of my ride. 

(Sorry in advance for mobile formatting)

For as long as I can remember I’ve always been into cars. As corny as it might seem, I really liked the Fast and Furious movies when I was younger (and admittedly still like them). But not the Fast 5+. Not saying they’re not good but they’re different (4 is like a transition movie, it’s neutral) but the thing I like most is the dramatization of the “car scene” in the first three. My favorite car was the 350z in the third movie, driven by DK. I thought drifting was cool, the car looked cool, that was my designated not-a-super-car-dream-car. 

For a long while that was the story until about 5 years ago I started watching YouTube more and somehow found Haggard Garage. I bounced from them to Adam LZ to now Jimmy Oakes mainly. I regularly check the Formula Drift scene. I “just knew” I had to be a driver on my own drift team. I realized I couldn’t afford a car or any parts or anything that drifting entails, and I bought a sim rig and have been busting it on Assetto Corsa. Graduating from college soon, I’m expecting I’ll have more disposable income (right? (plz lol)) so I decided I would start planning out a build. 

As a basis I picked a 350z I considered to be in good shape for about 8k. I added a list of all the parts I thought I needed to do ProAm drifting. I got a total of about 16k but I figured I could get away with a sum total of 10k. Just something solid to get into the scene with (I know this number can be wildly different depending on factors). But that then became the butt of the joke my roommate would have to endure for the next good while, “how do I make ten thousand dollars in two weeks?” (I started saying this way because it was like 2 weeks away from the end of this past fall semester). 

Once the holiday dust settled I realized I could probably buy something cheap, but trying to be reasonable I also realized I really don’t know jack about working on cars. I mean I’ve changed my own plugs, done some minor body work, changed a throttle body but really not much past that. I printed my resume and class schedule and I started talking to local shops asking if they had any part time work available. I ended up getting an internship/apprenticeship with a bmw performance shop. A car buddy of mine (who’s pretty much only had bmws and does what he can in his garage) recommended I check them out, and when I did it worked out great. 

After about two weeks there and some more thinking I pulled the trigger on a 2000 e46 328ci and I really couldn’t be happier. I haven’t done much to it, pretty much just gutting the back and starting maintenance. I’ve got a pretty decent build list put together for this one, guided by the manager at the shop I work at, and I’m hoping to go to my first event (a drift clinic) in early April. It’s not cheap and I’m trying to do this budget as I can but it’s actually working out. Slowly but surely. The things I’m learning from the shop, and the parts help I’m getting is really shaping things together. 

I want to share all of this with others, like those as I’ve watched on YouTube do before. So I decided to do it and recorded my first video of working on my car: https://youtu.be/Cn4rpmOKrf8

Regarding ASC,"e46 service manual says this:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Even with the ASC system turned off, if the ASC control module senses a difference in wheel speed (one wheel spinning) the control module will apply modulated braking force to the slipping wheel until traction is regained, but will not override fuel injection function.

&amp;#x200B;

when does it kick in? at high speed?

&amp;#x200B;

* for anybody interested:

&gt;Automatic Stability Control (ASC)  
&gt;  
&gt;The Automatic Stability Control (ASC) system works in conjunction with the Antilock Brake System (ABS) and the engine management system to enhance vehicle control. The main function of the ASC system is to maintain the rolling contact between the tires and the road surface under all driving conditions. This is achieved through exact application and management of braking and drivetrain forces.  
&gt;  
&gt;Note:  
&gt;  
&gt;The traction control system referred to as ASC (Automatic Stability Control)  
&gt;  
&gt;Suspension, Steering and Brakes — General [http://ebahn.bentleypublishers.com/BMW/3/E46/Repair%20Manuals/3](http://ebahn.bentleypublishers.com/BMW/3/E46/Repair%20Manuals/3)...  
&gt;  
&gt;4 of 24 2/25/2009 10:24 PM  
&gt;  
&gt;may also be referred to as ASC+T (Automatic Stability Control+Traction).  
&gt;  
&gt;The ASC system improves traction by electronically applying the rear brakes when the rear drive wheels are spinning at a faster rate than the front wheels. The combined ABS/ASC control module, operating through the ABS hydraulic control unit, modulates braking force at the rear wheels.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition, ASC will deactivate individual fuel injectors and override the motor driven throttle to reduce engine torque and maintain vehicle traction. Because the throttle is controlled electronically the driver cannot increase the engine power output during ASC intervention regardless of how far the accelerator pedal is pushed.  
&gt;  
&gt;The components that comprise the ASC system also function to replace the limited slip differential available in previous models. Even with the ASC system turned off, if the ASC control module senses a difference in wheel speed (one wheel spinning) the control module will apply modulated braking force to the slipping wheel until traction is regained, but will not override fuel injection function.  
&gt;  
&gt;Traction control also comes into operation during deceleration. Decelerating on snowy or icy road surfaces can lead to rear wheel slip. If a rear wheel starts to drag or lock up, the ASC system can limit the problem by adjusting throttle, fuel injection and ignition timing.  
&gt;  
&gt;A switch on the center console is used to toggle the ASC on or off.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ASC system is designed to be maintenance free. There are no adjustments that can be made. Repair and troubleshooting of the ASC system

I'm not beholden to anything except that's it's rwd and a manual.

That being said I'm having a tough time finding that haha

What I wanted to know is how the 330i drives performance wise?  I currently have a BRZ with a blower and some light mods like exhaust and headers which I had my local shop do - that car is a blast but noisy and kind of rough on daily driving on my local roads.

So I've wanted to get into tinkering with cars myself (and now I have the time) I figured BMW e46 330i or m3 would be the place to start.

Now I'm finding 330is for about 5k ish and m3's for about 12k ish (none of which meet my above requirements) but I figure one will pop eventually

Part of the appeal is working on the car myself - with that being said I was looking to hear some opinions from folks that have driving both the m3 and the regular 330i

The m3 seems like it will require more expensive parts and be more difficult to work on based on some of what I've read buuut I don't won't to lose on the performance - when I drop my right foot I want the car to scoot

I'm happy buying the 330i for 5k and then spending 4k in parts etc to tune it up and then modify it for performance - can I squeeze sports car performance out of the 330i?  


Should I get a 330i and watch for wrecked m3's to do an engine swap?

I’m thinking of just getting another but I feel like it will be all the same problems and headaches.  I’m leaning towards an e46 330xi / 5.  I feel like these are a little more affordable and I’ll have room to make some upgrades as opposed to just maintain.  
My biggest concern is the loss of power / torque.  I’m specifically looking at the xi’s for the AWD, definitely gonna get a 5 speed as well.  I was wondering if anyone had any firsthand experience driving either of these cars and how big the difference is.  
I’m sure there are posts in this sub about regular maintenance or things to look for when buying one (I’m leaning towards private sale) but any input would be appreciated.  I think the inline 6’s are much more reliable but if there are common issues or things to look out for feel free to comment.  I don’t know much about e46’s other than the fact they look super nice on the road, so even common knowledge would be appreciated.  Thanks!

"Need climate control help, flap motors","Hello guys and gals, 

It's starting to cool down, and of course I am now having climate control issues. I can't control where the air comes out anymore. It always blows upward towards my windscreen. I've done a readout and I have a host of errors all currently present.

1. Ventilation flap motor
2. footwell flap motor
3. Wrong airconditioning unit IHKR
4. AUC sensor
5. AUC heating
6. Solar Sensor

I converted from manual AC to automatic, and ever since then I've had the ""wrong AC"" error. The AC still works (hot and cold). Everything else always used to work well until last week. I think I'll have to check the fuses, and probably replace the flap motors (any resources?). What is the UAC part of the errors?

How would I reprogram my pump the way this user told me too?,"I put an 01 pump into my o2 (both mk60 units) and the default reprogramming didn’t work with ncs expert. A user on the e46 forums told me this:


For things like this, I'd probably just build it from the ZCS document. You don't have to add every single option your car has - just stuff relevant to the module you're trying to code. 

So for an 01 330i for example, if you search for AV53 in the E46ZST.000 document, you'll see the following: [code]AV53         65630000 0000204004201000 0000000000 1 LIM  M54B30        LL US  //Limousine 330i    US 06/00 - 08/01[/code]

MK60 was optional back then, so you'd want to add this:
[code]H MK60 N1099 00000000 0000000000000000 0002000000 1 MK60       // alle Fzg mit ASC oder DSC MK60
[/code]

Then the other thing is 01 cars had the overboosted steering rack with a different ratio - I'd add the ZCS string for the fast rack retrofit (which was standard by 2002). And if you look at that, it actually already has the MK60 code embedded in it.

[code]H LEN1 N0301 00000000 0000000000000400 000A640628 1 LENK_I_50 //(LIM,COUP,TOUR,CABR)+(M54B30,M57D30,M56B30)+SA210 ab 04/01
[/code]

So the final ZCS would be something like this:

[img]https://i.imgur.com/lgjwIsj.png[/img]

And I guess if you have an automatic transmission you'd want to add that to the ZCS as well.

Edit: Actually on closer inspection, it seems like the the C03 module might not have all the parameters for the faster steering rack (they must have switch to the newer module at some point before 2002), so OP might just have to live with the steering angle not being 100% accurate. Should be fine since people do rack swaps all the time without too much issue.[/QUOTE]

They didn’t tell me how to actually create such a zcs file and apply it and I made another post asking for help which got no response. How would I reprogram my unit as they described?

URGENT RECALL for BMW e46 3 series 1997-2000. Just happened in Australia in case you're unaware.,"I was just told about this urgent recall due to faulty airbags in relations to a recent death and serious injury in separate accidents in Australia in the last 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an Australian news outlet with an artical about it -  [https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/12-663-bmws-with-new-takata-airbags-recalled-immediately-after-fatality-20191107-p538h6.html?ref=rss&amp;utm\_medium=rss&amp;utm\_source=rss\_feed](https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/consumer-affairs/12-663-bmws-with-new-takata-airbags-recalled-immediately-after-fatality-20191107-p538h6.html?ref=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=rss_feed) 

Some things I took from the artical;  


&gt; BMW will offer to arrange a loan or rental car or ""reimbursement for alternative transport costs"" until parts are available for an airbag replacement, or until other arrangements can be made 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Customers may also discuss ""the vehicle being purchased by BMW"" 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the replacement airbag parts may not be ready for up to 18 months 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;   the airbag **inflator could rupture, causing sharp metal fragments to enter the vehicle cabin at high speed** and potentially killing or injuring vehicle occupants 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Transport safety authorities in Australia, US and Japan have identified a different type of Takata airbag that poses a critical risk of death or serious injury

Electrical issues,"Morning all

Just come back from two weeks away with work on Monday, and my 330D touring is having issues. I had to get a jump start to get her going to start with, which I thought was reasonable as it's been fairly cold. 

On my way home from there, my gearbox seemed to be playing up, trying to get up to motorway speeds was a struggle, she'd rev up, but it was like the gear wasn't engaging. This has been happening intermittently since then.

Today, she started ok for a short journey, but I went to start her again after that, and while she was turning over fine, the engine just wouldn't start. Eventually after many attempts she did.

My fan blowers also stopped, and now the air con unit seems dead, with no lights etc.

"320i no crank, no start, no dme communication over obd","Bit of background, recently swapped the engine in my touring after it dropped a valve. Got the engine in and running but didn't have time to put the front end back on due to work constraints.

Came back to the car after 2 weeks and the bastard won't start. No crank, no start and my code reader can't communicate with the car over OBD2. 

Have done numerous bits of testing over the past while to see if I can get to the source of it. Checked all the fuses, grounds to engine and DMe box are tight. Positive terminal is also good.

Did the key test to see if the ews and dme were communicating but no beep. From this concluded that the DME was toast and bought one off ebay. The one I got off ebay is now also not communicating and as the seller totally butchered the key I can't see if it is related to that.

So questions are:
What quick troubleshooting can with a multimeter? 

What points should be checking other than the obvious? 

Cars cluster is fine and not Christmas treeing, ABS does appear on after startup, is this related?

Would a new DME communicate through code reader even if the key isn't recognised? In gluing the key back together, the seller of my new dme got glue all over the keys pcb....

I have a kdcan cable for inpa so going to see if I can get any output from that this weekend. What should I be doing and looking for with this? Never used it. 

Really at my wits end here and this has been driving me nuts. Spent a lot of money on the car to bring it up to scratch and this close to just chucking the towel in and scrapping the bastard.

Only other option I've thought is to get an auto sparky to come round and have a second opinion. Would like to avoid this though as becoming now just a bottomless money pit

318i oil leak,"Hi everyone, just thought I'd get an opinion on an issue I'm having with a newly purchased e46. 

Bought a 2004 318i a few weeks ago and it drives amazing. I noticed a slight oil leak last week though. It was dripping slightly on the floor. I took it to a local garage and they found 2 oil leaks and 'fixed' it for me. 

They told me I should jet wash the under the bonnet so clean off excess oil, is this important? I do notice that I can still smell burning oil when driving and just this evening I have noticed when getting out of my car that where I had been reversing there was oil on the floor.

I'm really not sure what the problem is and now worried that I've bought a lemon. The car has a good service history and has done 86,000 miles with hardly any issues according to the log book.

Just bought a 2002 M3-HELP,"I’ve always loved the e46 m3, and just recently bought one sight unseen off eBay. The basic specs I knew going in were: manual, convertible with hardtop, oh, and 160,000 mi. It was a completely impulse purchase but it was and is truly my dream car. 

Cosmetically it’s pretty great for a 17 yr old car, but I’m fearing the worst when it comes to mechanical issues. When I got it, I wanted to get it looked up and down by a mechanic, but since it was a Friday night I needed to wait until the week. I mean the previous owner DD this thing; A few days of light driving couldn’t hurt, right? 

Problems began literally 3 days after it was delivered. Initially nothing seemed terribly sketchy; there was some belt squeak, but usually only on startup and occasionally at idle. Naturally, disaster struck- on Monday it threw a belt, unscrewing the radiator fan, and puncturing a gaping whole in the radiator. Thankfully I was less than 3 min from my house and it was freezing rain so nothing got to hot... I didn’t find out until I popped the hood when I was home. It’s currently sitting at my mechanics with a bill of $1,900 for a new radiator. 

I’m coming to Reddit becuase there’s no way this was the only thing neglected about this car, for gods sake the wiper fluid light was on when I got this car. 

What makes me even more concerned is certain little details about the car: a rusty tuning port mounted in the glove box, a specific 75 degree pipe on the intake that I saw for some sketchy “stage 1” set up online, the aftermarket head unit is grounded in the ceiling, the aluminum petals were drilled through the original ones (shattering them). 

I’m not afraid of aftermarket, I was planning on modding the car myself. I am afraid ,however, of negligence.

I’m waiting for a call back from my mechanic once the car is running to find out if anything else is fucked. If it is do I just call the thing a lost cause? Or fix it to the best of my ability and sell it? 

I’ve dreamed of this car since I was young, and to sit in my dream just to have it destroyed becuase of a shitty previous owner would kill me.

It's not the fastest 3-series out there, but once that little diesel has warmed up it really pulls. More than fast enough for now :) and it's a manual! 

The only issue I have with it now is a buggy moonroof switch which does the opposite of what you want it to do, and when I idle in one spot for too long I can smell some exhaust fumes; this doesn't worry me too much though since I know I need to replace the exhaust, it's a tad rusty.",e46,1574007187,matthew1652001,5,1,True,2019-11-17

"Selling my 2003 330i, 126k miles, $3500 (metro Detroit, MI)","I'm selling my 2003 BMW 330i. I've owned the car since 2013 and I'm selling to buy a bigger car for a growing family.

The car runs great, A/C blows ice cold. Leather seats are in great condition, the leather on driver's seat was replaced with OEM leather in 2018. New BOSCH Premium battery installed in August 2019. DISA valve was replaced in 2018. All oil changes done using OEM (Mann) oil filters and Castrol Edge Synthetic European Formula oil. Maintenance has been completed at an independent BMW repair shop. Check engine light is on, but it is only for a fault with the exhaust oxygen sensor which only affects emissions. All windows and sun roof work without issue.

The driver's side fog light is missing and the assembly needs repair due to hitting a blown out tire on the freeway.

I can email you an AutoCheck report on request, similar to CarFax.

E46 M3 SMG Issues,"Before reaching out to r/BMW I figured I'd as the E46 community here for their thoughts on an issue I've had with my '02 E46 M3 convertible for the last year. For context I bought it with just over 104k miles and have put about 1500 miles on the car since I got it a year and a half ago (106k now); previously a southern car and I'm either the 5th or 6th owner without having the Carfax in front of me. I store it during the winter to avoid the salt they throw down on the roads and from late March-early October I take it for spins on the weekends and even to Watkins Glen International a few times.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I stored it away last year (2018) I had the SMG cog warning light come on and immediately replaced the salmon relay, which solved the problem, or at least so I thought. Once I took it out of storage this spring I would frequently get the SMG cog warning light but only in really specific cases. For example pretty much anytime I start the car up and then put the car in reverse, the SMG will pop into 0, a noticible thud noise will come from underneath the car, and the SMG light comes on. Rinse and repeat 2 or 3 times and I'm able for the reverse gear to actually engage when on the throttle and I can back up, but it's not done yet. The same thing will happen once I am into 1st and just start to ease the throttle to start moving, same issue (but not as frequent as backing up). I get that only putting 1-2k miles a year on the car probably isn't helping since it can sit for 2-3 weeks at a time before being driven, let alone being stored for 4-5 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Since the SMG light comes on every time obviously something's up with the SMG and it's probably the original motor. But I just can't pinpoint what exactly to replace; replacing the entire unit isn't a problem of cost, but obviously a easier solution is preferred. Anyone else run into something similar to this? Thankfully I have a few months before I take it out on the road and have my own lift to work on the car with (gotta replace the rod bearings this winter too while I am at it also).

 I have been getting some new codes on my e46 325 cic, yay, anyways im getting lean codes  for both banks(P0171 &amp; P0174), engine cut off time (P1515 Engine off timer Plausibility) and P0444 Evap Purge.

I have been aware of P0444 for a while now, changed gas cap and didn't solve the problem, next is changing purge valve but i havent able to buy it yet, but im kind of living with it for now. The other two are kind of new though, and I get them at the same time but not the same frecuency (lean codes happen often but it will sometimes trigger engine cut off), I also can confirm that power loss is not noticeable, but the car should be faster, besides that sometimes you feel the car ""shuts down"" when taking a heavy curve while accelarating hard.

Maintenance items I have done so far at 120k miles that may be related:
-Vanos Seals
-Upper &amp; Lower Intake Boot

My mom drove my old 325Ci without coolant for a couple miles 😣,"I gave my mom my old 04 325Ci Sulev about a year ago. It was my daily driver for 10+ years, put in about 135k+ miles. I always made sure coolant was topped off, Oil was changed on time, tires/brakes were good. She took me to college, took me to work, took me to concerts. Accomplished many life milestones with her. She was my baby. 

My dad called me one day and said that one of the radiator hoses became un-done while my mom drove home from work and all the coolant spilled. First thing I told him is MOM GOT IT TOWED HOME, RIGHT? Nope. She drove it home.. for miles and with the temp gauge on red. 

My heart sunk. I felt like my best friend got hit with a terminal illness. I'm still hurting from the news. My Dad fixed the hose and topped it off with coolant and made sure all the air bubbles were taken care of. ""Car"" is still running ""fine"" according to my parents.  

Fast forward a few weeks, I'm at my parents visiting for Thanksgiving. I checked out the car for the first time; I didn't get in but I observed my Mom start the car and saw her drive away in it. 

My old gal sounds different :(

She's running and driving, but something sounds off. I hear no knocks or anything, no obvious sounds but it sounds like she needs lubrication or something. She doesn't purr anymore, she just runs.

‘05 325ci convertible side mirror cable,"Hi I’m hoping someone can help. I’m replacing my side mirror on the left side (Aussie so the passenger side) I’ve found a replacement unit ( see link ) but there is an extra red cable plug that my old mirror doesn’t have, it has the same 3 pin black plug just not that extra red part, is this due to it being drivers side in the US where I’m ordering from? And will it be fully functioning if I just connect the black and leave the red? I can’t find an exact copy of my original one anywhere, with just the black 3 pin plug. Sorry for the stupid questions but it’s an expensive part and I can’t afford to get it wrong. Thanks if anyone could help it would be much appreciated :)

Wheel speed sensor questions with DSC/Brake/ABS lights,"Hi all,

After the northeast US storm the last two days, I started my 325xi this morning to find... Well, first it flipped the fuck out, showing a red temp gauge (despite being covered in snow and a cold start, lol) and the gear symbol. I turned it off, checked the codes to find nothing, gave it a minute to brush some snow off, and when I turned it back on it threw the DSC, ABS, and a yellow brake light. Torque isn't telling me any codes for it. Got to work ok, though it was sliding a bit on an unplowed section of the street. Guessing it's a wheel speed sensor, but I don't have any way of figuring it out.

I've got a trip coming up this weekend, so a couple questions... 

- Is there a way to check cleaning them off without having to get new ones?

- Do the xi models have a different sensor? I'm seeing different listings on Amazon, at least for the Autex branded ones. I don't want to spend $100+ on the Duralast ones... 

- I'm not aware of any cruise or speedometer issues, and I saw that one thread on e46fanatics about it being a diagnostic for which one might be off. Is that accurate?

Tested parasitic drain, it was showing 0.01-0.02 amps when on 10amp mode, so I guess its not draining.

Right now Im thinking its alternator. Its never higher than 13.7v driving and idling. With lights on and climate control on it can drop to 13v. Afaik alternator shouldnt drop below 14v with/without load and my seems never higher than 13.7",e46,1575889889,cAliberBang,0,1,True,2019-12-09

Its a 330i M54 6-speed with 145 000 km / 90 000 miles.

It was purchased brand new by an older gentleman in 2004 who recently sold it to the current seller a couple months ago. So pretty much all the mileage is by the older man. 

The seller has full service documents from the day it was purchased with receipts of everything that has been fixed/changed on the car.

It is equipped with comfort package, M sport package, PDC, Sunroof, upgraded sound system and other small bits which rounds up to about $7000. The total price of the car when new was about $45k in 2004.

As far as what has been fixed/replaced on the car (*bear with me as the receipts are in Swedish and translate isnt the most accurate with these complicated names)*

 **Fuel pump, all ignition coils, Gas pressure spring, intake hose, washer fluid pump, change of adjustment unit of intake, right side xenon replacement, sunroof cable change, new locks.** The thing that worries me is that nothing about the coolingsystem has been fixed or replaced.

Any ideas on these issues?,"2004 325ci. Manual. 96k. All regular maintenance and the usual replacements and repairs. 

April: Threw code P0172 'Engine too rich'. Runs like a dream except loss of power/slow to shift at very steep inclines with 25-35mph around 2800-3200rpms. Will stick at the higher rev and not shift. Perfect on level ground, downhill, or higher speeds, even at higher speeds up similar inclines. Mechanic says it's okay, just don't romp on it. Maybe try cleaning MAF sensor.

May: clean MAF sensor, improves slow shifting issue for a few weeks, come back mid-June.

August, two weeks ago. Car is borrowed. Is returned and now displays -40F on display which I believe is a temperature gauge issue. Bring it to mechanic. Do an oil change while I'm there, ask about -40F display, we schedule an appointment for him to diagnose everything in a few days. He breaks his ankle. Cancel appointment.

Today: Go out to pick up food, car battery light turns on and then immediately I lose power and it turns off, coolant light comes on, car two gauge shoots all the way up to hot and lights up.  I pull over, turn accessory on, turn the heat up all the way, pop the hood, wait 30 minutes for it to cool down. Look under car while waiting, nothing dripping or hanging. Visually look at engine bay, nothing looks obviously wrong to me ... Wait another 20 minutes to open coolant reservoir, since it still feels pretty hot. Open, coolant explodes EVERYWHERE, blows cap out of my hand... only have a few bottles of water. Dump those in, wait another 15 minutes, start car up, temp gauge slowly goes back to middle. Drive about 100 feet...instantly overheats again. Walk to gas station, buy coolant, wait another 30 min, dump in coolant, wait another 30 minutes, try starting her again...overheats again. 

It's Saturday and I won't be able to get her towed and looked at until Monday, so I'm gonna be searching here, e46fanatics and everywhere I can obsessing over what it 'could' be, I figured I might as well ask the community directly.

Fixing P0741 on my 70k mile e46.,"So i recently got this code and different people are advising different things. The code is:

P0741 “Torque Converter Clutch Solenoid Circuit Performance Or Stuck Off”

The shop i took it to wants to change the torque converter for $1600, I just bought the car 2 months ago so that hurts.

A friend said that the first thing he does when he has transmission issues is change the transmission fluid, and that it works sometimes. $300. ( I'm pretty sure the transmission fluid has never been changed in this car.)

Another friend said changing the transmission fluid probably wont do anything.

A shop I called recommended changing the whole transmission for $3k!?!

The car drives completely fine, I put about 700 miles on it since the light when off as I was in the middle of a roadtrip during labor day weekend. The only thing I noticed is some minor shaking when driving at 40mph. Otherwise it was completely smooth on the highway.

My first choice right now would probably be to let the shop change the torque converter but I'm afraid that they wont solve the issue and I'll need to put more work into it.

Am I an idiot for wanting to swap my '02 330ci for an '03 320 'vert?,"I've touched on a bit of drifting with a couple of cars (Skyline, e36) over the past 12-13 years, and wanted a cheap way to give it another go as a daily driver, as I reach 40 years old.

Where to buy a ZHP - Am I Screwed?,"So my dream car is the E46 ZHP (preferably the coupe - timeless design)... a close second or tie would be the E39 540i M-Sport or M5. I’m 22 years old and going to graduate college this December. I have been watching ZHPs on the market since I was 16, and recently the average mileage is increasing and the average condition is decreasing (as any car would as time passes)... also the cars that are in good condition with less miles are crazy expensive.  I wouldn’t want to buy one and have it be my daily, it would be a weekend car. With where I am in life, mixed with the ZHP market becoming less and less abundant, am I screwed?

04 330xi Random Misfire,"On a cross country trip, I stopped for gas. After fueling, I started up and the idle was a touch rough about a block from the gas station. Pulled over and checked codes. P0301 and P0302. 

Cleared codes and did some stop and go driving for a while. No issues. Shut down, got some lunch, and when I fired it back up it was rough again. This time P0304 was there. Cleared, repeated the same routine, and everything was fine. 

I put on another 600 miles with no issues. Two days later, started up and had P0305. 

I never got the actual random code P0300, and no fuel codes associated.  Also never got an SES light. I’m leaning against coils/plugs since it’s bounced around a bit. No mixture codes is leaning me away from injector/pump issues. I have had issues with the SAP in the past, so maybe a vacuum issue???

Advice on poor acceleration / sluggish after coming to a stop,"Hi guys - looking for some advice!  


So I recently got a 318CI bmw with the n42 engine, and randomly when I come to some stop lights, the car idles but vibrates quite a lot, sometimes the rev bounce, others they don't. Then, when I drive off, its very sluggish, it won't move above 5 mph yet the revs will keep increasing. After about 5 seconds then the power will kick down and I'm off. Its happened twice at a roundabout so far, so im getting bit nervous.  


This used to happen right after I got it a few months ago, but it would accelerate poorly and then stall when I come to a stop (Its an automatic). After changing the Crankshaft sensor, we did a smoke test and found a crack in the Air intake resonator box which I have since patched up with JB weld, which made it run amazingly for a while but now this has started happening. Its had new spark plugs, oil service, fuel filter (just the other week), air filters and coolant flushed and changed.   


So my question is, with this all in mind does anyone have any clue as to what could be causing the sluggish acceleration? Since fixing the air crack, it no longer stalls right after this occurs which is good as It got to a point where it was dangerous. Sorry its a long one, but any advice would be appreciated :) Thanks!",e46,1568303709,RPHD26,19,2,True,2019-09-12

I checked torque on everything which was still in spec. No excess play, and it made no noise turning the wheel when on stands.

Clutch feels weird when I ease into gear,"Hi guys,

I'm a new E46 owner, a manual 320i, made in '02. I got it in April this year, it's my only car and I'm not sure whether the following is a feature, or a symptom that some parts need replacing.

# The Problem?

I'm no race car driver, but I do enjoy the occasional spirited drive. Now, when I shift, rev to about 2000 and quickly release the clutch (no dumping, just a quick release), the transmission seems to *connect* better, or at least there is more power to the wheels, making the car accelerate **notably** faster.

However, when I sloooowly ease into gear, the car feels kinda lazy even after the clutch has been fully released, even when I kinda floor it (after a slow release). 

It only ""wakes up"" after press the clutch and do a quick release (still no dumping though).

# The Question

Is this the way it supposed to be or is my \[TRANSMISSION\_PART\] on its way out?

# Dual VANOS

I've read about the Dual VANOS a bit (variable valve timing on intake and exhaust), and from what I understand (from forums mostly), a computer *guesses* my current driving style and then *feeds*?  the engine accordingly.

This week, it was at the body shop because a building fence fell on it. I honestly - I know this sounds stupid - felt a bit sad, knowing I couldn't drive it for a week.

I immediately took it for spin in the Alps. Turned off my phone and just blasted (well, I took whatever that POS engine had to give) through the twisties. I was so damn happy, giggling like a child. Because of a car worth €2k which is ugly, slow and undesirable.

Another Window Thread (I'm sure),"Hi all,

I've searched high and low and am finding conflicting results so I figured I'd try here to see if I could get a little more specific information.   


A couple of days ago my passenger window decided that it didn't want to go up anymore. I pulled the door card off and tried the mechanism and the motor works fine. At least I assume so because it's not grinding and sounds like it does the the full cycle both up and down, the window just doesn't ride with it when it goes back up. Is it possible for windows to fall off the track like that or is that a symptom of needing a new regulator? 

Also, I unplugged the battery and removed the airbag as part of this diagnostic. I turned the key on without the airbag on just to check how things were working without it plugged in and now the airbag, DSC, ABS, and one more light are constantly lit. Is there a home remedy (app or something similar) to turn those off? I read about shorting out a lead somewhere, but I'd rather not do that. Is there an OBD II code reader app that can do that?

"Upgrade head unit? Ideas, tips, must have apps?","Hi E46 owners,

First of I wanted to say: Some beautiful cars in this subreddit! I'm an E46Ci owner for years now and finally decided to upgrade my head unit to something more advanced. For the last years I've tried numerous different options: AUX cable, Dension Gateway Light. While the Gateway is nice and works pretty good, I would prefer a more sophisticated head unit with support for Car Play, Navigation, etc. So I'm here searching for some advice and guidance on buying a good unit. I could have also asked this in r/AndroidAuto but I decided to go here first and find a good unit and discuss the E46 specific parts, before going there for the ""Software related"" aspects ;)

So lemme explain: I love the interior of my E46. And I prefer OEM parts. It's like a tick. I guess there isn't a modified/non OEM part in my car. Having the AUX cable hang out from the glove box hurt me, that's why I opted for the Gateway. The only part still annoying me is the microphone placed on my dashboard. I already have the the OEM mic ready to be placed at the upper lighting panel \^\^. I will install that with the new radio.

So as you can tell, pulling the original Business CD Radio out is a tough decision for me. Fortunately there are some manufacturers out there, producing units that mimic the look of the original Navigation unit: Dynavin, Xtrons, Pumpkin, etc.

Another pain point is the installation. Since I have the Business CD Radio, I also need to upgrade the carrier for double din support: [http://bmwfans.info/parts-catalog/E46-Cabrio/Europe/320Ci-M54/L-N/2004/browse/vehicle\_trim/storing\_partition\_mounting\_parts](http://bmwfans.info/parts-catalog/E46-Cabrio/Europe/320Ci-M54/L-N/2004/browse/vehicle_trim/storing_partition_mounting_parts)

Which one is the correct one? I currently have Business CD Radio and smokers package. Interestingly, most E46 have smokers package but are non smoker cars (in my experience). And since I'm not smoking, I want to upgrade to ""non smokers package"". Because I will loose the upper storage slot this makes the lower one a bit larger (for storing glasses, etc.). So it looks like **51** **16** **8** **202** **186** is the correct part. But what is the difference between the carrier and the ""**Instrument panel, switch centre**""? Do I need both (and thus also **51 16 7 001 408)**? Tbh, I don't know if I have a switch centre there or the single switches. Need to take a look later.

Another option would be the panel by Dynavin: [http://www.dynavinshop.eu/dvn-e46hrsusb.html](http://www.dynavinshop.eu/dvn-e46hrsusb.html). While it is not an OEM part, it looks pretty well manufactured and designed and has two USB ports. I would prefer that over having USB ports hanging around in my glove box.

Another thing I'm looking for is the Resler interface (sorry, German): [http://www.reslers.de/IBUS/index\_de.html](http://www.reslers.de/IBUS/index_de.html). It reads data from the CAN bus and a nice Android app can display a lot of the cars stats.

&amp;#x200B;

So to sum this up: I'm a 04' 320Ci (facelift), Business CD Radio (17 round pin), no cd charger in trunk owner.

1. Which head units can you recommend, both, in style and functionality? Feel free to share pictures of your setup. Do they support the 17 round pin plug?
2. Which parts do I need for the installation (carrier, instrument panel)? Has anybody fitted a third-party one like the Dynavin I linked?
3. Has anybody experience with the Resler interface?

I pulled over confused and attempted to start it again and just kept cranking. I waited a minute or two and cranked it again and it seemed to want to start but would instantly die on me.

I couldnt hear the fuel pump priming so I bought some starter fluid and she fired right up. I then concluded that my fuel pump had probably gone out so i bought a new one swapped it in and nothing. I then thought maybe a fuse or relay blew so checked those and replaced a relay for good measure and nothing. Still no priming sound from fuel pump. I towed it to an indy shop in town and theyre claiming the dme is out because its not sending power anywhere. However I still have spark? And the cel still comes on when the key is in ignition. Plugged an obd scanner about 2 days ago and it read a dmtl leak code but i've had that for a while so I believe thats irrelevant.

A very very odd problem on my 04 325Ci,"Ok so this is a weird one and I’ve been getting some conflicting answers off of the forums so I’ve come to consult the elders.

CONTEXT- I bought my car for my first car (I’m 16) 3 months ago. 137k, fully unmodded, pretty clean, all original paper work (stuff like the black book) and to top it off, BMW enthusiast owned. Like a serious enthusiast, he owned 3 other BMWs- M240i, Z4 and a 328i (all 2012 or newer I believe). Got it for a solid price, 3400. About a month after buying and after putting around 1000 miles on, got a check engine light. I can’t remember the code exactly,  but my brother (20, owns a 97 328i and is a guru on BMWs but is sadly at college). Other than that, I’ve had no problems except for the topic for this post. Got an oil change and tire rotation 2 weeks ago. 

THE PROBLEM- So after starting the car, the idle is rough. Like the car vibrates and sounds generally icky. Below 2k RPM it drives rough as well, but past that it’s smooth. Top end power also disappeared. The kicker is though that if you cycle the car (turn it off and on again) the problem goes away fully. Since it happened the first time it’s happened about 3 times. I would have not driven it again after the issue arose but I needed my car as last weekend was homecoming for me. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, suffice to say I’m afraid for my wallet",e46,1569849473,Umber27,2,1,True,2019-09-30

"So, I just bought an e46...","I bought it because I needed a daily driver first, and wanted to scratch the itch to meddle with motors second. The year is 2003, model 330i M sport, manual transmission, miles 80k, everything looks OEM (I guess), price £3,900.

The car looks in very good shape, some wear (no tear) in the leather seats, at first inspection no rust on the body and no rust in the wheel arches, the car started immediately. Nothing alarming in the MOTs (like rust in the frame) so in the end I hope it was a fair deal.

&amp;#x200B;

After watching videos on basic/initial maintenance I'm planning to:

* replace the fluids
   * engine oil (castrol 0w40)
   * transmission fluid (pentosin mtf2  is discontinued, what to use?)
   * power steering fluid (valvoline max life dex mercon red bottle)
   * differential fluid (OEM)
   * brake fluid (super dot 4)
* replace the cooling system (hoses, head gasket, etc..) while taking a look at other things like water pump or VANOS
* replace spark plugs, injectors

&amp;#x200B;

After that I'll probably go and change:

* brake pads and discs (do I need to change calipers as well?)
* tires + rims
* suspensions

	

Then I'll probably start with cosmetic stuff:

* taking care of rust
* deep cleaning
* replace worn out stuff
* put an Android head or something similar (still undecided about this)

	

Finally I'll work a bit on the engine playing with it, after all I bought this car as a learning experience as well ;)

What is the best advice you could give me? What am I missing/doing wrong?

Is the order of things fair or should I prioritize differently?

E46 Piston rings Vs swap,"Hey, currently own an 2005 325ci in a very nice spec so I definitely don't want to get rid of it, however I've come to notice that recently there has been a huge increase in how much oil it consumes (around 1L per 500km) and I also have a lot of oil residue in my exhaust, this has led me to believe the piston rings are worn out, so now I have 2 options; either buy a M54B30 and swap it in or rebuild my current engine, what would you do? What do you recommend me to do?

Too good to be true?,"So I already have a 2002 318i Touring with a decent spec. Basically, the only thing it's ""missing"" out on, is a sunroof and leather sports-seats. Also had a smashed up front bumper I've yet to get around replacing, and a dodgy left fender that does not align. But ever since I bought it, I've always played with the thought of having a straight six instead. But they're pretty rare around these parts; most E46's here are the base 316 model.  


But today I found a very interesting car for sale, and it's only about a 20 minute drive away aswell. It's a 2004 320i Touring,with the same specs, except it also has a sunroof and leather sports seats and of course, the M54 instead of N42. Even the same beutiful sapphire black aswell. Odometer at about 205k km.The seller asks for the equivilant of 1200€ for it. There are however a few things that needs to be handled:

\- Fuel line from filter to top

\- Change hand-brake and brake-shield

\- Driver-side window regulator (heh, classic)

\- Flickering xenon-light (ballast done for?)

\- DISA-valve has had it's guts removed as it was close to falling into the intake

\- MAF is faulty

\- Leak somewhere on the line to the headlight-washers.

\- An oil change

\- A new ""road-worthyness control"" in the near future (within january 2020).

&amp;#x200B;

Things that the seller has done while owning the vehicle:

\- Changed head gasket

\- Change head ""cover"" gasket (?? possibly talking about valve-cover?)

\- Changed servo-pump

\- Changed water-pump

\- Changed thermostad

\- Changed transmission-gasket, flushed and new oil (auto transmission)

\- Changed springs and dampers front and back

\- One wheel bearing in rear  


I'm heading out tomorrow to look at it, but what do you think so far? It is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than any other running and (legally) driving E46's around, especially when you take into consideration the engine.

So three questions:

2) The technician suggested there are some places online that will rebuild the module for around $300 (you ship it to them, which I'd be willing to do. Anyone have a recommendation for that sort of service?

3) Any alternative modifications that would allow me to just delete/replace the DSC module with an alternative configuration? Not sure if this would even make sense, just curious what my options are",e46,1570203638,asinum-fossor,34,6,True,2019-10-04

Strange noise while driving,"Car is a 2001 330xi with 94k miles.

While driving there is occasionally a strange “brrrrt!  Brrrt” noise coming from I believe the left front suspension.  It is not a pop, bang, or clunk.  If you’ve ever heard the “brrrrt” sound of an A-10 Warthog firing its cannon, it sounds EXACTLY like that.

Anyone ever come across this?  What I have found:

-It occurs only while driving straight over certain types of pavement.  No noise when turning either direction.  I went on a drive with the CCA up in the mountains this past weekend and it was smooth and silent through all manners of switchbacks, curves, etc.

-It is not speed dependent.  It happened at 30-35mph and 80+ on the freeway 

- it does not make the sound on speed bumps, or any kind of dips.

- I checked out the suspension tonight and the only thing I could find was a torn tie rod boot.  Tie rod itself appeared fine.  Could it be that?

Thermostat and Operating Temperature,"Question for everyone. 

Watching my temps as I drive and my 2002 325i runs at 87c consistently when on the highway, and about 89c-93c when idling in the driveway. Ambient temp was about 35f (1c)

Does this sound like the engine is running hot enough? I know running too low can be a problem for these cars with engine moisture build up, and I just want to make sure I'm all set for winter. I have seen posts on the forums about soft failing thermostats, but a lot of them are running 80c or lower when they are experiencing these issues.

My big debate is if I should do a rush thermostat job now, or wait until after winter when I plan to do a full coolant system overhaul.

Before I got the car I could move off with the clutch quite a bit without the use of gas, but I noticed for a few weeks now that I can't do that anymore. If I were to get the biting point and move the car without gas it would move ever so slowly. Further increasing the biting point it would shake the car, which to me didn't feel normal because before it never did that.

Engine Swap Query - 325ci to any other engine (recommend),"Hi everyone, I am planning on buying a 3 series 325ci E46. I live in Australia and am on my 'p' plates. This is a restricted power license. 

An M3 is too expensive and too powerful however the specific 3 series I have found looks amazing inside and out. It will be my first car purchase and I plan on keeping it forever or as long as possible.

In about a years time if I own the car, I would like to engine swap it to get more power (I will be off my p plates). As I said above the looks of this specific car are why I would like to engine swap it, rather than sell and upgrade. 

My question is: 
Is it worth it? I plan on going to a mechanic to do the work for me.
Is the swap quick? (I like the idea of a B58 however anything else that fits can be considered)
What engine should I swap in if I was to do so?

RPMs either stay too high or are delayed coming down when at a full stop.

My question is, can a bad MAF cause a P1500 code and cause EML? I will admit, the MAF I bought was from Amazon so I am assuming that its the culprit, but before I go buy a new (more expensive MAF) I want to make sure that this can in fact cause that specific code and issue I am having.

Cooling system problem,"Hello everyone 

I have a 2001 325i sport that needed a new expansion tank so I went ahead and and changed lower hose and sensor ,upper hose, expansion tank, thermostat(auto) and expansion tank level sensor and bled the system by filling it till no bubbles came out the bleed screw hole and then turning key to position 1 and turning ac to hot on low fan for a few minuses.

I removed some of the coolant as I noticed it dribbling out the back of the tank where its joined together like the lid (not filler cap) I removed fluid till it was below the lid and it still reads max but the coolant light wont budge

There is no leaks at all and it holds the level in the tank but the leaking from rear of expansion tank was worrying I think it was an aftermarket tank should it do that?

I tried the old sensor again and it gave all clear on the dash for a about 30 seconds of engine running then came back I'm worried the tank is faulty or I have over filled it and bust it.

Can anyone advise my next step? Kind of stuck thinking of trying the old tank again or returning the new one

Any help is much appreciated

"Electric radiator fan presumed dead, testing options?","I have an '03 330xi automatic, but did the mechanical fan delete mod and now have only the manual version electronic fan.

I overheated at a red light the other day, and it continues to happen, narrowed it down to my electric fan never actually turning on.

Easiest way is to unplug the coolant temp sensor, put ignition in pos 2 and run the AC, but I still get nothing.

I'm getting 12 volts @ the connector between the large brown/black wires, and the PWM signal wires seems to have voltage on it as well.

The simplest test I can imagine would be to run 2 wires from the car connector, ground and +12v, to the ground and PWM wires respectively @ the fan connector to essentially ""hotwire"" it to determine if the fan control unit is dead itself.

So I did this, and still nothing, I'm basically ready to order a new fan, the one I got off amazon lasted a whole 3 months.

Central underside leak,"Hi all,

Airbag light was on, pretty normal from what I hear, and the gear lever was a bit loose, but nothing too major. Was about to pick it up when I decided to have a lean over and look at the underside. Saw water drip from the centre, which I assumed was from the AC which we turned on before entering the motorway for about a minute and turned it straight off, so not too sure if it would still be draining.

As soon as i turn the A/C on, the coolant temperature is fine during idle. But when i start driving the coolant temperature starts going up to 99,101, 102 even 104!!

The only thing i can think of that could be causing the issue is the electric fan conversion... but I've tested the fan with INPA and it seems to be working great. When i turn the AC on I hear the fan kicking into high gear.. when the AC is off I hear the fan spinning at a slower speed.

I've replace the water pump(last month) and the thermostat housing(today). The radiator was replaced a couple years ago along with the expansion tank. I had the AC recharged about a year ago. I've bled the system properly according to TIS and the car runs great without the AC on.

Not sure what else I can try here....

Any ideas?",e46,1563146792,elevatewave,21,3,True,2019-07-14

Reoccurring issue with throttle pedal,"Hey guys, I’m hoping someone a little more experienced may have an idea.

So a little background, the car (02 325xi) needed the clutch replaced last August, I figured I could probably bust it out in a week having never done a clutch before. Well fast forward to now the car just got back on the road a few days ago many new parts and headaches later since I was going to school and working through most of the winter/spring and haven’t had much time to work on it until recently.

So, the car’s back on the road now (ish) and after a few bolt checks, leak fixes and miscellaneous finishing touches taken care of, I’m having a reoccurring issue with my dash lightning up like a Christmas tree. Specifically the traction control, abs and brake light all come on which seems to be a pretty common issue usually related to the steering angle sensor. Easy right, calibrate the steering angle sensor, all the lights are gone, throttle works again. For a little bit anyway. Then the issue comes back.

So what I’m wondering is are there any sensors I should look to replace, any fuses I should check, is this possibly a software/ecu issue? I’ve dumped way too much time and money into this car to let this stupid issue stop me from diving it. I’ve tried just about everything I can think of.

Unpleasant smell from air vents,"Hope someone is able to point me in the right direction, because this has been driving me crazy.

Whenever I'd had the AC running for a little while and turn it off, I get a very unpleasant smell out of the air vents. To clarify, it doesn't really get bad until AFTER I've disabled the airconditioning. If I do turn on the AC at all, it is not noticable.

So far I've had the aircondintioning cleaned at a local Kwikfit and I've tried cleaning the air ducts myself by spraying disinfectant in both the vents from the inside and from where the cabin filter goes.

I can only describe the smell as organic.

Evap System Question,"I am having some trouble getting my head around what exactly the evap system is, and how I can fix mine. My car has been throwing the p0440 code, for the evap system. I have replaced the gas cap and the Purge valve, and the CEL always comes back in around 200 miles.

Basically my question is related to the hoses in the evap system, and if they have anything to do with the CCV system. I know my car has a vacuum leak because there is a very slight whistle around 2000 rpm. However I am not noticing a decrease in performance. I also thought that cars with CCV problems would throw codes p0171 and p0174, not the evap code.

Apologies if anything I said didn't make any sense, because I don't know the evap or CCV system well. On a very basic level, my question is if a vacuum leak (maybe DISA valve for example) could cause evap system problems?

Bad alternator?,"Using the dashboard voltage test the battery sits at 12.5v after being trickle charged.  Idling the car voltage is at 11.6v with lights and radio on.

Weird idle at startup,"Hey guys, so I've been noticing that whenever I startup my 2001 325i in the mornings, the car idles very strangely. The RPM on the gauge is steady but I could feel the car rocking quite a bit, and along with that is a very delayed throttle response. It calms down after around 1 minute and goes back to normal after it has warmed up. Is it just the car warming up or is something going bad in the engine bay?

I recently bought this car for 4500AUD with receipts for an overhauled cooling system (radiator, thermostat, hoses, expansion tank and water pump) and so far it's been a blast to drive, just need to get the bushings replaced soon though. 

And also, does anyone know how to fix or get rid of the worn soft touch material in the centre console? The material is peeling and does not look very appealing. Cheers.",e46,1564393575,Eddie10089,27,2,True,2019-07-29

Idle Control Valve Stuck - Replaced With New - Help!,"Hey everyone,

So I got the trifecta of lights: ABS, DSC, EML, along with thumping when letting off throttle/no power. This had occurred in the past, so I already knew what it is. This first came up in April, so I had the idle control valve replaced with a Bosch unit in May so that my car would be ready for June track day. I also had all my intake boots replaced with new ones. 

I scanned the code when it came up again yesterday. And as expected: D3: dme: idle-speed control valve mechanical fault

Any ideas on this? I find it hard to believe that a new unit from Bosch would fail within a month. Especially because I purchased it from FCP Euro.

Power steering noise diagnosis,"2003 325xi.  I had it in to a shop for a full inspection a couple months ago, and they noted that the power steering fluid was very dirty and needed flushing, they also mentioned that it could be due to the power steering pump failing.  Within a couple weeks there was a increased ""groaning"" sound coming when turning, much more noticeable when stopped / slow speed.  I flushed out the fluid using the ""suck out and add"" method, putting 3L of new ATF in.  That definitely helped with the noise, but now a few weeks later its back and is a bit louder.  I am prepared to replace the pump, hoses and reservoir, but I want to make sure that is actually the problem.

With my research, I've noticed that similar steering noises seem to mostly be one of these: 

* Suspension issues - One sway bar link was broken and both were replaced. All other steering / suspension parts were fine.
* Power steering pump - Mentioned in the inspection report.
* Steering rack - No issues according to the inspection.
* Leak in the system allowing air to enter.

Symptoms:

* First thing in the morning when the engine is cold, there is minimal noise.  After the engine warms up it is much more noticeable.
* When I had the front up while flushing the fluid, there was almost no noise from the steering system when turning full left / full right
* I do not see any ATF leaking, at least there is nothing on the ground under the car, and the fluid level seems stable.

I'd just like to make sure I'm on the right track with the pump before I invest time and money in parts and doing the work.

Also, any experience with the \~$100 power steering pumps I see on Ebay / Amazon?  The OEM at my local parts store is $500.  I get that the cheap ones probably won't last as long, but I just need it to get my though a year or two. I only do around 20K kms a year.

I love my 2004 325i and it was my learner car as far a repairs go. The poor thing has taken a beating, and I think I may have killed it. 

This post is 2-fold:

1. The repair:

Throwing code: P0306 misfire in cylinder 6. 
-Switch ignition coils, no change on code. 
-Replaced spark plug, no change. 
-compression test: low pressure in cylinder 6. 
-coolant is...empty (damnit). 

So I’m told this is either a cracked head or cracked head gasket. I don’t have the skill to replace the gasket I think. So either one will cost more than the car.

-Found a 1998 Z3 convertible in good shape for a good deal.
-Found identical 325i to the one I own but manual trans(improvement in my opinion) at a dealer for a decent price. Accepts trade-ins so I could put my dead car towards it.

Then the shop tested my battery and told me to go to Napa and get a new one so I did and Napa charged me $218 for a battery and the guy said that was the only one so I bought  it. The battery was replaced in like 10 min and the car still wouldn't start. I already missed a day of work because I was stuck up north. I got a ride back down about 2 hours and called after I got off at work today, for them to tell me the engine seized up and it would cost 2500-3k to repair. Im 18 and just graduated so....  I told them I would call back but I honestly don't know what to do. So if anyone lives in Minnesota or the north who would like to buy it message me or any tips please lmk or has a spare engine I could buy for a reasonable price.

"Buying an '01 320i in the United States? Bad idea? don't care about speed...got that, not many options near me.","So as the title implies, I am wondering if buying a 320i in the states is a terrible idea. I know that the engine is different than any models from the states in so much as its displacement is lower than any US model.  


My concern is consumables, brakes seem to be the same as the 323 so I got that. Not sure about other common items like valve cover gaskets, oil pan gaskets, oil filters, anything else like that.  


Does anyone here have any insight on the commonality of parts from this Canadian model to any US ones? I'm not scared of it, has 130k and probably needs some gaskets done and if I can't get them then screw it. If I can't do oil, brakes, or other consumables - forget it. Otherwise it should work for what I want which is another car to drive here and there - I have a 400+ RWHP 6 speed already so I'm set on speed and handling and track worthiness in that car so I don't care that the 320 is slow. 

The 320 is a sport pack at least.

And unfortunately I can't find any good or reasonable priced e46s near me - one good auto and a couple other questionable manuals with high miles for high dollars. And I don't want to drive to another state or something for a car...I don't even have the time.

As the title says, I am trying to find out if there is a way to capture the data that is coming from the speedometer. 

I am taking a class on data analysis right now and I would like to hook my computer up to my E46 (2001 323i) and record the values that the speedometer reads out with respect to time to produce a velocity vs time graph. 

Is there a program that would record all this data? Even an app would work as I have an OBD2 scanner that connects to my iPad. I have tried to install PA Soft before but it hasn't worked out due to OS but can def give it another go if it will be useful.

Really weird wheel wobble situation,"The car: 316ti compact with 164k km

New bits: New control arms (10k km), new tie rods (3k km) 

The problem: between 90-130 km/h the steering wheel wobbles. But it's caused by the front passenger tire. It only wobbles over imperfections (albeit small imperfections are enough). It's as if the wheel isn't properly damped. You know how you drive over an imperfection on the motorway and you feel it in your steering wheel? It's like that only it happens very often in succession. The car also pulls veeeery slightly to the right after the summer tire change one week ago (tires were fine a few months back). When I make a slight right turn, the vibrations also reduce which I don't understand

What it can't be: Control arms. I had a wheel wobble due to worn control arm bushings and it was constant. Warped rotors: Under braking, the vibrations don't increase, they rather subside or stop completely

I'm looking to put a new exhaust on it on the cheaper side. I see some of the vibrant mufflers are pretty common and they're ~$130.

I also found a good condition stock ZHP muffler available locally for $100.

Just realized I'm that guy now...,"I've always loved BMWs, especially the M models. Ever since getting my license 3 years ago, anytime I was out and saw an E46 M3 I freaked out and got super excited. I absolutely loved seeing them on the road, and if I saw one in a parking lot I would go check it out. It had been my dream car (right after an R34 GTR. Unfortunately I was unable to get one for my first car as my dad wanted me to get something AWD, automatic, and with a warranty so it was out of the question. 

But recently I had taken a lot more interest in them, learning a lot about them through a new friend I met at school with a 330i. I started looking around on car sale websites. Then one day at autocross, I got the opportunity to take a lap in one. That day I knew I had to get one. I found the perfect one 3 days later, an imola red 2006 convertible with a stick for an amazing price and enthusiast owner. 

I managed to convince my parents to let me sell my 2014 Infiniti Q50 Hybrid Sport for it as they didn't expect me to still want an old 2006 car 4 years later. And with the CPO warranty expiring on the Infiniti soon, we also realized how rare of a car the Hybrid Sport is and how expensive the parts would be and that it would be impossible to maintain myself due to all the tech and modernness. I only used the CPO warranty twice in my 3 years owning it, yet the bills for that ran me over $5,000. Along with that, the car had already lost a lot of its value, and was doomed to plummet even further as all Infinitis do. In the next few years, even a single repair would cost more than the car is worth.

As much as I miss that car and all the memories I had with it, I am way more happy driving my M3 everyday which meets everything I wanted. Its rear wheel drive, a convertible, and stickshift. The handling is remarkable, even on ""the cheapest tires that would fit"" (soon to be replaced), it feels so stable at any speeds and it's almost like curves and corners in the road don't exist. It has been an absolute blast owning this car and I've already done a few maintenance items where the aftermarket is cheap and plentiful.

Anyways, driving through a city yesterday for the first time, I had multiple people stop and compliment my car. I could feel they had the same sense of joy and enthusiasm that I always had seeing an E46 M3 around. I noticed this to an extent driving around my town where many people would break their necks and look at my car. But driving through the city with tons of people, my buddy driving behind me said he'd just see other people passing by taking a look at my car. I just can't believe that I am that guy now. Being the one who is actually driving the E46 M3, the one who made my day every time I saw one driving down the road. I feel very privileged to be driving this car and will be keeping it for as long as I am alive. I feel very lucky that I was able to attain my dream car at only 20 years old (also helps that my dream car only cost $12,500 unlike many peoples that are six figure, heh). I just love my car.

Sorry this went a bit long, I just wanted to share my story owning my M3 and how excited I am to finally own the car that absolutely made my day anytime I used to see one. It was just a sudden realization for me that I am now the guy who is able to bring that same joy to everyone else.",e46,1556530073,TypicalM3Driver,24,31,True,2019-04-29

I’m trying to troubleshoot a weird situation. Whenever I hose the rear left side of the car (basically on the rear lights) there’s a tiny amount of water which makes it into the boot from there.

Pulling Intake Manifold: how to inspect CCV?,"I replaced my CCV and all hoses. I reused the intake manifold gasket and sucking jet pump and three lines.

Before and after the CCV replacement, I have a hunting idle, so I smoke tested after and found a leak either where the sucking jet pump meets the intake manifold or the intake manifold gasket at cylinder six. Pretty sure it's the sucking jet pump because I rotated the line which loosened the one-time use hose clip.

However, the hunting idle could indicate a stuck open CCV. Further, I have excessive crankcase vacuum, and I'll stall with the oil filler cap pulled at idle. All three indicate a stuck open CCV.

Oil Cap Removal Test,"If you look up the removal of the oil filler cap from an M54 engine as a diagnostic, you'll find two opinions: suction and stalling means you have a stuck open CCV or vacuum leaks (because the system can't cope with one more leak). 

Opinion two is that suction and stalling means your CCV is healthy, as you're introducing a vacuum leak, so it should stutter.

Before I replaced every vacuum line and CCV component, I would open the cap and idle would change. There was little suction. It wouldn't die. My CCV was clogged at this point, too.

Having replaced every line and CCV part, removing the cap reveals ample suction and will stall the car after rough idling. I just took it all apart again after a month, and the lines are clean and tight.

The snows were 15” 205 tires.

I had the summer tires rebalanced and while they balanced ok, there was some run-out like a slightly bent rim. I found a set of used after market rims and had them tested for run out prior to mounting tires, they tested good so I had the tires moved over/balanced.

Rotors are good, new in the fall and there is no pulsing/vibration in the brake pedal. I’ve looked at ball joints and tie rods and they looked good.

Couple questions about oil leak,"My BMW e46 325ci went for yearly inspection at the shop and they came to the conclusion that my Lambda is too high. They suspected it could be because of an oil leak, possibly the oil filter housing gasket. I went to check if there is oil there, and indeed there is so I will replace that for sure. 

But my first question is, can Lambda be too high because of an oil leak? It was around 1,25 instead of the allowed between 0,97 and 1,03. What could be other reasons?

And than for question 2: I wanna replace the gasket myself because the shop charges a lotttt. I checked out this video guide on YouTube and it seems doable yourself. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlHaqtVMMn8&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlHaqtVMMn8&amp;t=1s)

A commenter on that video noted it wasn’t necessary to drain all the oil. Instead just remove the oil filter &amp; lid. Is this true? Would be nice, since my oil is still good.

Snapped a bolt doing an ATF change...,"I replaced the trans fluid in my ‘02 325i (GM Trans). When I was putting the pan back on, one of the bolts that was in the kit either was overtorqued (didn’t feel like it) or defective (they were slightly different) and the head snapped off, leaving just the body in the car. I tried drilling it out, but didn’t want to make the issue worse.

So, right now the car is put back together, just without ONE of the trans pan bolts. After a bit of driving yesterday, I didn’t spot any leaks, but am obviously worried. Do you think it’ll hold? Or do I need to drill that piece out &amp; replace it? Or have a shop do it?

I tried an extractor kit, but the clearance is so low that it’s hard to get leverage down there.

I’m obviously most worried about leaks, and then the eventual destruction of the trans, but if this will hold for another 80k, then I’ll just deal with it. Otherwise I have to drop the whole thing again next weekend. I already complained to FCPEuro about the bolts, because they’re clearly not the same OEM ones, and were definitely a little softer.

That said, she definitely shift smoother... Putting the pan back on wasn’t the part I was expecting to be hard...

Possible heater core leak?,"Hi everyone, I need some help figuring out what to do about what I suspect is a coolant leak in my heater core. My 325I is leaking coolant but only when I have my heat/defrost on, I can't think of anywhere else this would be. I've bled the system twice, and have never been able to find any leaks or spots on the driveway. To add to the fact I believe it to be the heater core is that on occasion if I drive it a bit hard (say about 4500 RPM) I can smell coolant in the car. I am fairly certain it's not the expansion tank as I drove 160 miles without any signs of leaking with the fans off.

Is my engine shot?,"Hey guys, I did some work on my cooling system this weekend. Replaced water pump, thermostat, expansion tank, and some hoses. I put it all back together and poured probably less than half a gallon of coolant in. Stupidly I ran the car for about a minute or so and it started making a knocking sound (almost sounded like pre-ignition knock) and losing rpms, so I turned it off right away. Added the rest of the coolant (until it came out of the bleed screw hole) and ran it again and the problem was still there, again after maybe 45 seconds a knocking and loss of rpm. 


I know it was extremely stupid to do this, and regret it a bunch. I'm getting it towed tomorrow to a shop to have them look at it. In the meantime, how screwed would you guys say I am?

E46 325i engine felt like it was about to stall on idle and fuel somehow vanished from my fuel tank?,"So, I went out for work with slightly below 1/2 tank of fuel left, the fuel level remains the same when I reached my workplace, but after 8 hours when I started up the car and was about to leave, the fuel level suddenly dropped to 1/4 tank, and I can feel the engine vibrate and felt like it was about to stall when idling but without RPM drop or any SESL... I tried driving it to the nearest petrol station, but everything feels normal when I'm driving, there's no power-loss or hiccups, the vibration only happens when I'm in P (AT btw) and idling. 

After filling up my tank the vibration problem went away... 

Before you ask : 
1) Yes, I've replaced my spark plugs, coils, fuel pump and regulator + filter about a month ago.
2) No, I did not yell at the car.
3) No, there aren't any loud intake noise when I'm driving.
4) The only light that came up on the dash was the oil level yellow light, but that's because I have a faulty oil level sensor.

After changing the plugs and oil to NGK and BMW 5W-30, I did a code check and got 11 codes. Cleared the codes, drove a few miles and got them all back. Here they are.

P0300- Random Misfire detected
P0302- Cylinder 2 misfire detected
P0303- Cylinder 3 misfire detected
P0304- Cylinder 4 misfire detected
P0305- Cylinder 5 misfire detected
P0306- Cylinder 6 misfire detected

P0135- O2 sensor heater circuit bank 1 sensor 1
P0141- O2 sensor heater circuit bank 1 sensor 2
P0155- O2 sensor heater circuit bank 2 sensor 1
P0161- O2 sensor heater circuit bank 2 sensor 2
P1182- O2 sensor (bank 1 sensor 2) open circuit during coast sown fuel cut-off

And then would the rest possibly be fixed by changing the O2 sensors? It looks like there are four, is that right?

Any other ideas too?

It happens : 

* when I remove my foot from the accelerator and let it slow (not touching the brake) 

* during normal acceleration on first or second gear 

* when I switch gear first to second, or second to first.


I supposed it's something related to play/looseness on the transmission. I had to change my flywheel so I took the opportunity to replace some stuff, but the noise is still there.

* Universal joint 

* Center Mount 

* Transmission bearing set

[ I have a few questions. First I should mention the condition of the car. The odomoter is at 192k kilometers. I am pretty sure it's clocked but it doesn't matter. The car has no rusts and overall the exterior is perfect. The subframe has no cracks. The timing chains are starting to rattle and will probably be changed next week. I bought new brake discs and pads and new struts because the old ones were really bad. Still haven't changed them. Since I got bilstein m tech struts I was wondering if they would fit the springs currently on the car \(factory sports suspension\). Also I bought g12+ \(red\) coolant because I had the opportunity to get it with a big discount. Do you think it would be okay to run this coolant? Next I was wondering whether the expansion tank\/water pump\/thermostat are absolutely necessary to be changed since the car seems OK right now. Money is kind of tight since I already spent a lot of money on parts and need to spend a lot more to get the timing chains changed. After I'm done with the major things I plan on reinforcing the subframe.

Aux fan on automatic seized - consequences?,"Hello fellow masochistic e46 owners,

I was driving the other day in my automatic 325i sedan, and since it was the first nice summer day in Ontario, I naturally closed all windows and popped on the AC. It had seemed a bit lukewarm the other week, but appeared to be working. However, after several minutes, it was still blowing \~30 C air at my face, and I cursed, because this was the first of the summer e46 issues this year.

I read up on the AC system, and had someone stand outside with the hood popped when I toggled the AC. Lo and behold, the aux fan didn't budge. We then tried to nudge it with a trim tool to test the bearings, and the blades wouldn't budge.

My question for you fine folks is, do I understand correctly that:

1) the AC won't come on if the aux fan doesn't trigger and

2) the aux fan should be rotate-able/spin if nudged?

2003 325i m54 not turning over.,"The cars at 150k miles and I loaned it to my mother for her to get to work and back. On her way back the car started to fail and she had to pull over and then the car died. We tried replacing the battery on site and nothing so we got a tow back to my house. From there I diagnosed the alternator as failed so I replaced it and got the battery charged at autozone (2 years old only 9/17). So then I put everything back together and put the battery in and its still not turning over. Just sounds like a machine gun going over and over.

Question about bushings,"Hey y'all. 

I need to replace my front subframe bushings because they're shot. And since we have to drop the subframe I figured why not change all the bushings there. So on this picture number 10, 11, 25 and 26. 

Just like in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VchsUNrnXrc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VchsUNrnXrc)

I also figured to replace them with better ones than stock, so I was looking around for some options. Powerflex is a popular choice. But I'd have to pay +- €330 for all the bushings if I buy from them. 

So my question is: Is that a good deal? Are there brands that make them just as good and cheaper? Is this even a good set or should I buy somethings else regardless? Thanks for the help. I live in the Netherlands, so a brand located in Europe is preferred because of shipping costs.

The goal of my website is to help everyone all around the world including professionals or even someone who is turning wrenches in their backyard on a project for the very first time.

Some of the content you will run into on my site are the likes of product reviews,  industry news,  how to's,  and various other topics.

I wish that everyone who comes across my work and site enjoy all the information they read and actually benefits of what I have to offer to this world.

Weird battery problem,"So this is super peculiar. I have a 2001 E46 330CI convertible. It has been running fine until two days ago from which 2 suspecting events have happened. 

1- I had the car washed, including the hood. I’m not sure how it was washed, I left it at a car wash. The car ran fine yesterday after getting it washed 

2- I removed the EWS box after getting it washed in the evening to code a new key via the AK90+ tool. Done successfully

Now after refitting the EWS box, the battery was flat which was weird because nothing was running but I didn’t think much of it and jump started the car. It took slightly longer than usual, but eventually got the car to start fine. Today morning I had to get it jumped again, and took it to get the battery checked. Apparently the battery life is fine and still strong. But once turned off, all power goes. 

I don’t even get that ‘tuk tuk’ sound of the car trying to turn over. Everything is black. No lights. But the moment i connect the jump leads, the boot lights turn on and the engine turns over instantly. Its the most peculiar thing. 

Im wondering if anyone has any ideas what this could be? Thanks ",e46,1551033333,noumaaaan,0,1,True,2019-02-24

[Help] E46 2003 Xenon Headlight Failure,"E46 coupe pre-facelift with factory fitted xenon headlights. 

Been having this problem for over a year out and 3 trips (to a BMW specialist and an auto electrician) still haven't figured it out.

Began randomly where mainly the drivers side xenon wouldn't turn on. Sometimes the passenger wouldn't. Sometimes both. Happened more on winter. Eventually it became the drivers side permenantly not working.

Tried the obvious 
1) new bulb - still not working
2) new ballast - still not working 

Swapped the ballasts and bulb around with the passenger side , yet the driver side still doesn't work.
Figured it must be the headlight internally 

3) New headlight (used) with new bulb and ballast. Came on at first, then intermittently went off. Next day stopped working completely (the drivers xenon)

Wiring looks ok, cleaned it all with electrical contact cleaner and no damaged insulation etc.

I'm stuck now, any thoughts anyone? LCM?

P0171 P0174,"BMW 325i 2001:

Just got these codes, can the MAF sensor cause both of these?

Watched a video on how to diagnose the MAF sensor, turned car on and let it idle and unplugged MAF. According to YouTube, car should turn off if it works, but mine stayed on. Was this an accurate way to diagnose the MAF sensor?

Also went to oriellys to begin with and they scanned the codes.

227 and 228

227- Vacuum Hose

228:
- Engine intake air duct
- MAF
- Positive crankcase ventilation
- Positive crankcase ventilation 
- vacuum hose
- o2 sensor

So those were the things that could be causing the codes to go off.

Power steering issue/question,"Hi all,

Came out to the car today to realise there was nearly no fluid left in the power steering reservoir, was making weird noises as I pulled out of my space. There were quite a few bubbles, making me think this happened fairly suddenly. 

Looked to see the fluid was coming out the bottom, seems the skid plate is ducting it out into a nice drip. I had checked the fluid two weeks ago, so this seems fairly sudden. Can't see any leaks from the top, my guess is its probably the high pressure line that runs along the bottom. 

I was wondering if I could get away with still driving it with topping up the fluid while I look for a fix? It's my only car.

I have a really good line out on a very cheap 2001 BMW 330xi in the same color as my 2002 325xi. I absolutely abhor the pre-facelift look but the price and the mileage is a little too good to pass up. Anyway, I waned to swap the car's front ends and headlights and then sell off my 2002. I had a few question

1.) Ive seen this done before but without mention of swapping the kind of headlights.

2.) Are the Body Panels just pulling them (hood, fenders, bumper) off, swapping the side markers, and putting them on the car? Does this work both ways?

3.)If the 2001 has Halogen Reflectors and I want to swap them with the 2002's has Bi-Xenons. This is obviously not plug and play. Are there any wiring diagrams I might be able to use? If there's a harness that would be better. How would I run that power. If I go to a BMW dealer will they program the Computer for me to run Xenons?

4.) If the 2001 has Xenons how hard would it be to swap them to bi-xenons.

5.) How about putting 2001 lights onto the 2002, I would imagine this would also need some work.

Other information: the 2002 has AL bi-Xenons and doesn't have automatic headlights. I just had them refinished and replaced the bulbs and had the ignitor fixed on the left side.

New to the forum: wheels and susp.,"
2004 330xi w/sport package &amp; 6 speed manual
110,000 miles
Original suspension
Original 17x7.5 sport wheels
Currently has blizzaks

What’s up.  

Bought this as a daily driver for my hour drive to work on a twisty highway.  Really like the purchase so far.  The linear power is awesome.  It could always use a bit more, but this is perfect for my intended use.  
Been a busy winter.  Purchased car in August but band aided everything until December to ensure I understood what was needed. Since then, Ive changed all the fluid, cv joints, replaced the valve cover gasket, ignition coils, plugs, pads and rotors all around.  
Still need to change out the serpentine belt and replace the oil filter housing gasket.  After that, I’m good until something inevitably breaks.  I will eventually get a wrap or paint the roof and hood as the paint lost the clear coat in those spots and the paint has faded.  Unnoticeable from 10ft so not really a high priority atm.  

End goal:  slick and stock e46 that is more tweaked than modded.  Picture an old man you come across and think, “Damn, that’s a pretty cool e46 ol’ dude is driving.”

Where the help is needed:  
1) Suspension:  drop 1.5” to 2” with ride feeling  as close to oem sport suspension as possible.  That’s the tough part.  I understand the popular shock and coil packages that lower to the desired height, are probably a bit too stiff for what I am looking for.  At 25, it wouldn’t have mattered to me, but now, my tooshy is more sensitive :)

2)  Wheels:  17x8 or 17x8.5  but what offset?

When the suspension lowers it will close the xi fender arch gap, but I also want the tires/wheels to come out a bit more than they currently do.  This could be corrected by the wider wheels, but I’m not sure.  That’s where I start to get lost.  So I have no idea what offset will do that with the 17x8 or 17x8.5.  I’m almost looking to line up the wheels to outside the fender arch, but not entirely out there of that makes sense.   Although I think some stance cars look awesome, this thing is being built up to be a nice original looking e46 example.  I’m not looking to roll the fenders or anything like that. 

I’ve looked on forums and can’t find the details needed for an xi model.  I understand the xi sits higher for a reason.  But the amount of snow isn’t really an issue.  In my area of the Midwest, the snow is more icy than anything else. The reason I needed an xi, is bc my commute has one large downhill as I leave town and one large uphill as I roll into the town I work in.  In between are 40 minutes of high speed sweepers and a few hard turns.  I leave early enough that I tend to beat the plow trucks.  This first winter, the xi with blizzaks have been better than my 80 series cruiser on all terrains bc of the Xi’s comparatively lighter weight.   Time is ticking as I am needing to purchase my summer wheels and tires as the blizzak tread will melt away as the temps increase.  Ideally the wheels would be oem.  Perhaps the style 5.  To me the style 5 wheels seem to be the quintessential bmw wheel.  Not as awesome as the csl wheels, but again, slick and stock looking is the end goal.  

Anyways, thanks for reading and any help would be greatly appreciated.

330xi Random Misfires...Head Gasket???,"Hi guys. 2005 330xi. 160,000 mi. Hoping to get a little expert advice trying to pinpoint this misfire problem I'm having. 

2 weeks ago I started having these rough idle/random misfires right after i got gas somewhere. Maybe coincidence, maybe not. And then symptoms would persist only after its been driven a while and plenty warm. And only starts at low rpms when idling somewhere. In the beginning if it happened, i would just shut the car off and restart it and the symptoms would go away for the time being. Now it's becoming worse and more often, almost anytime i come to a stop. The idle will suddenly dip real low, run really rough and start misfiring. 

The first time it happened i took it to the mechanic and he said he pulled SAP codes. Lean codes. And o2 sensor codes. He did not get any misfire codes. I apologize for the lack of specific codes and my lack of education on the matter. I had him replace the o2 sensors. Didn't replace the SAP as he suggested that most likely wouldn't cause symptoms i described. 

The o2 made a huge difference with rpm and mpg but was still having random misfires. When I took it back he ran diagnostics on it again and had several misfire codes. 1, 4, and 5. He said those cylinder misfires are usually correlated with a failing head gasket. He did a compression test on cylinders and said misfiring cylinders were low. I forget the exact numbers. He said there is no way to know for sure until do a smoke test. But can still be driven. 

Following this, I drove for 3 days without an issue. was getting excited maybe the problem worked itself out. Bad gas or something or other. I drove fairly long distance, stopped to refuel, and then it started misfiring/trying to stall. 

I understand the next step is to do a smoke test and leak down test on cylinders. (Is this different than a compression test?) I'm hoping it's not the HG obviously. 

I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and what the issue was. I'm wondering what the process entails that'll determine if it is the HG or not. I'm wondering if anyone could suggest another possibility to have my mechanic check/replace. I'm wondering if the SAP (secondary air pump) could cause any such symptoms I've described. 

I'm wondering if this car is worth saving. I've already put about $3000 of work into it.

Diagnosing smoke test and errors.,"Hi r/e46. I am hoping you guys can help me with my 2000 328i. 

The CEL came on a while back and I let it sit for a bit since it's not my daily driver. Since I have been trying to get it ready to go back on the road again I have replaced the alternator, all the spark plugs and coils, the fuel filter and the lower intake boot which had a crack in it. I checked the ICV and the DISA and they both look fine. CEL came back on after clearing the codes and using the USB BMW scanner I am still getting a code that reads ""Activation, solenoid valve, tank ventilation"".

DISA Valve Issue or MAF," So long story short I was having issues with idle and vacuum leak. Which I discovered was due to a bad DISA valve. I replaced this part the other day and the issues were fixed and service light went off. Weelllllll in doing so I cleaned up some of the components around this part including the electrical connectors that go into the MAF and the DISA valve. The only thing I had on hand was carb cleaner and I thought this would be fine, but after reading I found this may be bad. Well last night about a day after replacing disa and it running fine i suddenly got a VERY rough idle and my car stalled at the light. I turned it back on and revved it up to not stall.

Misfires/stalls from cold start? (Fuel pumps/filters?),"I'd been having misfires/stalls from cold starts in the past, but chalked it up to old coils and a vacuum leak, both of which have been fixed since (DISA o ring and old coils!).

&amp;#x200B;

However, this past little while, I've been having recurring stalling when starting cold (just pulling out of the driveway), and today,  a failed start on the first attempt, followed by the joyous rocking of an engine misfiring and failing to regain equilibrium. The car ended up running fine after a few minutes, only a pending misfire fuel cutoff in cyl 5 showing on my OBD scanner. This has happened more than once in the past few weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

I've just realized that the fuel filter hasn't been changed in god knows how long (previous family owner never did and it's been in the family for 5+ years) and bought one to replace it. I'm wondering if this is a cause of the unhappy cold starts (I know it has a pressure regulator and can get clogged), or an aging fuel pump (never replaced AFAIK), or maybe a defective plug/coil (but all 6 cyls have been given new coils/plugs within the past 2 years).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone Ever Replaced Front Wheel Bearing on AWD e46 Without Removing the Knuckle?,"Have a 325xi and I think the front wheel bearing are bad. It makes a rumbling noise during acceleration so it’s either the bearings or CV joints. Bearings seem more likely and are far cheaper to try first.

Anyways, videos I’ve watched always involves removing the entire knuckle to press the bearing out on a ship press. But... on videos for rear wheel bearings people have done it without removing the knuckle but they did remove the axle. My thought is that for the front of an AWD car, it’s going to be very similar to the rear wheel bearing replacement. Would it not be possible to simply push the axle/CV joint out by first loosening it and then turning the knuckle until the axle comes out? After that it should be the same procedure as replacing the rear wheel bearing — use a bearing kit to push the bearing out from behind. Right? Or is there something I’m not foreseeing?

Auto trans was initially drained and filled with Redline D4 ATF for the first time in it's lifetime at 112, 133 miles - no issues before, but wanted to do preventative. Most forums say D4 is perfectly compatible with Esso and lots of good posts with people running Redline D4 over Esso.

Cleared and reset, drove to work this morning- no issues.

Looking for thoughts, looks like most people say Esso/D4 is suitable, thinking maybe I should drain and fill with Esso fluids (again) to see if I can counter the o-ring in the TQ that's failing, or if it's just impending doom of the TQ.

Loud Engine Bay Noise help for M3,"Hi!

My car is at 102k miles. I daily it. 2 nights ago, I drove it 2 miles and then parked it in my garage with no obvious issues.

Yesterday morning the car wouldn't start. The battery was dead. It clicked a bit but nothing more. I have a battery charger, so I plugged it in that day and overnight.

This morning, I started it up with no problems. However, it immediately started making a horrible rattling sound coming from the engine bay.  I popped the hood, and it seems like the sound is coming from the right side of the ""engine"".

Does anyone know what would be making a loud rattling noise around that area?

I was thinking maybe it would have been alternator related, but that's more towards the front between the air filter and the oil filter right? The fan seems fine, so despite the timing I don't ""think"" it's a cooling system issue?

It's still running ""fine"" as far as I can tell, and I can rev the engine a bit without it seeming louder or worse. I've only kept it running for a minute or two out of fear.

Should I sell my car and buy an e46?,"I am a high school student and a few months ago I bought my first car, a Hyundai Veloster turbo.

Will the e46 cost me *that* much more to maintain that I won’t be able to afford it?  I would have the money saved from the veloster sale along with another ~1000 in the bank. 

What should I look for when buying?  How many miles should I stick to?

For the key hole in the trunk I read the owners manual and it just says turn it as far as you can to the right. On some bimmerfest forums I read maybe 90 degrees or so, but I basically can’t move it past about 70 degrees (I’ve definitely attempted twisting it very hard to the point where I was worried I might break the key).

Filled until no more bubbles from bleeder screw. Only problem was coolant level light is staying on. I suspect I just need a new sensor.

I drove it for a day and noticed no leaks. This morning I checked the fluid level and it was low so I filled it up. There was no active leak that I could see. I drove it to work and it didn’t overheat. Any idea what it could be? I’ve already replaced the water pump a couple weeks ago. I don’t notice any hoses leaking.

Advice needed,"I’m looking at the H&amp;R touring cup kit as a suspension replacement/upgrade right now. I wanted to do bilsteins with H&amp;R but they don’t kit anything from what I’ve found besides the B12 pro kit and I don’t want to drop it much, just a little and a little stiffer.

"Brake disc, pad and spring change but theres loads of rust- what to do","So i’m after some advice. I am really struggling here. I have a 2001 BMW 330CI convertible that is super rusty underneath. The car was sitting for a year before I got it, and although it runs fine, the brake pads are quite crumbly so I thought I would change them. The brake discs also don’t look in great shape and the rear springs are gone to sh*t. As such, I got the materials and thought i’d do a DIY

For the last TWO DAYS i’ve been struggling on this and it’s killing me :( I’m trying to remove these big bolts off the callipers (i think 17mm) and I feel the nut is rounded. No amount of WD40 is loosening this guy up. How can I get him out? 

Also, for the rear springs, I have the same issue. No twisting or turning despite emptying a bottle of WD40 is helping. What can I do? I don’t really want to spend £100 at a mechanic when I know I can do this, i’m just being stopped by le rust. Any help is super appreciated!!

Back up sensor question,"My ‘02 M3 has the outdated/fairly useless factory satnav unit, which I would like to replace with something like a dynavin however, it also has a back up sensor.

If I replace the HU, will I loose the functionality of the sensor? I would really like to update the unit to something with a little more modern practicality (Bluetooth, touch screen, modern navigation, etc) but I think loosing the backup sensor would actually be a dealbreaker for me.

For the last tyre (passenger front), the small screw that holds the disk in was stuck and no amount of trying to pull loosened it up. It ended up getting rounded and after consulting YouTube, the best course of action seemed to be to use a drill and hammer it out. 

Unfortunately, 2 hours later and the bolt seems obliterated in the hole, and although there is a little movement in the disk now, it still wont come out so what can I do to get it out? Linked below is what it looks like. Any ideas welcome!!

E46 328 Project with some problems on the way,"Hi guys, this is my first post on reddit and I'm seeking your advice.  


Just changed engine on my E46 320 1999.  
Now I have 2.8 with 180.000kms milage (legit really!) and it was working with automatic transmission in e39.  
It works well with my manual 5-gear transmission and 3.38 differential but I want to change it soon for 3.0 setup (6 gears + 2.93 diff).  
But first things first - I need to fix my exhaust manifolds.  
Why? One of previous owners got creative and removed cats, leaving those manifolds with empty cans and fooled somehow lambda probes. Now after swapping engine and ECU I constantly suffer from EML+ASC after starting her. Sometimes it appears, sometimes not. Usual fix for this: I drive around the block, stop, turn off engine, reset throttle (pressing on gas while ignition is on for 10 secs) and let her rest for 10secs. After this procedure she USUALLY runs fine. But sometimes not...  


So my question is - can exhaust manifolds swap fix it? I mean I want to put some performance manifolds without cats + wrapping them with thermal bandage. My idea is that this could prevent exhaust gasses from recirculation as they probably do now in empty catalyser cans.

When I lowered my car initially I used 10mm spacers all round to eliminate rub on the shocks. Recently I went to install new brake rotors and pads and found these 10mm spacers were firmly seized on and the hubcentric rings on the spacers were cracked. Turns out the hub lip is around 10mm so the spacer isn't quite thick enough to fit with the hubcentric part over the lip, so it bends and cracks. So, I installed 20mm all round and those don't have this issue and seat fine. I believe someone told me on here 10mm spacers don't work, turns out they were right 😅.

P1348- misfire during start, cyl 4
P1344- misfire during start, cyl 2

P1085- fuel control mixture lean, bank 2 sensor 1
P1083- fuel control mixture lean, bank 1 sensor 1



I have no idea where to start with figuring these out. There were no prior codes to these, and they all popped up at the same time. Possible fuel filter/pump problem? 

I do have plenty of experience with working on cars, but not with BMWs, so I'm not worried about doing the repairs. I just don't want to throw money aimlessly at parts hoping it fixes the problem.

Double Washer on M54 Cylinder Head?,"I removed my valve cover on my 2004 330i, and I noticed a washer around the stud/flange nut nearest to cylinder one and the spark plug one hole. I poked it with a pick, and it popped off, revealing a layer of brittle gasket or gasket maker. I cleaned it off, and behind it was another identical washer.

The washers are smaller than those used to seal the valve cover. No other stud/flange nut has a washer. The VCG was destroyed at that point, as well. 

I was thinking it was an attempt to repair a damaged VCG or level a warped head or valve cover?

If you look at photos online, you'll see most people have bits of their valve cover gasket stuck at the same place, but I've never seen an extra washer there.

Please someone save me from these problems,"Hi everyone.

A few months ago I got a 2005 320i from some random dude for a pretty cheap price.

It drove fine for a while, but started stalling and rough idling while spitting out tons of white smoke out the back.

I brought it home, changed out the spark plugs that were pretty gunked out, but it went back to normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, after a few days, the problem came again. rough idle, tons of smoke, happened on the highway. I was convinced this was a head gasket leak, and that the coolant was leaking, so i got one of those sealers and put it in the radiator. After idling the smoke dissapeared, and everything appeared back to normal. i also changed all the coils to brand new bosch ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, now, a few days ago. the smoke happened again. and this time i thought it was the ccv. i checked, and sure enough everything connected to the ccv basically just broke off. i got a new ccv and tubing, and installed it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my issue now:

\- slight rough idle, but never stalls while idling.

\- stalls whenever i only push the gas pedal a little bit. 

\-if i push it past the specific point where the engine will stall, the car revs up real fast after a slight jerk.

\- gear changing is way higher rpm than before, but the changes are smooth, not jerky.

\-i cleaned the iacv and the throttle body with a little wd40, could i have not cleared it all out

\- saw a very small crack on the smaller lower intake boot, but it was where it was connected to the throttle body, so i didnt think much of it.

\-smoke is mostly gone though, might not have driven it around as much

&amp;#x200B;

any help is appreciated... i just want a car i can drive normally at this point :(

"Hi everyone new owner here, I have a few questions (and an introduction)!","Hi everyone, I just bought my first BMW and so far I love the e46 niche I’ve been introduced to. As opposed to my last car ($8k Mitsubishi that easily cracked 250k with almost no maintenance done) i bought this one for just a bit over $2k. Wanted to forgo car payment. I have a few quirks that I’m working on right now with it, so if you’d like to go straight to those feel free to skip the following 3 paragraphs. 

With that extra money from not having a car payment i would like to put some love and care into this car like I did NOT do for my last car AT ALL. I have a certain source of pride, because even though I’ve already had my own car for 4 years this was the first one I own outright. Never ever thought I’d end up with a BMW because I’d always heard horror stories about the maintenance but a close family member sent me the ad for a 2003 325xi and I thought it looked alright. Texted the guy would he take a few hundred less than he had it listed for. He said yes!

The next morning I was there to check it out, and this guy’s phone is BLOWING UP the whole damn time. He shows me a text that just came in that says they have $2500 cash and they can come right now. But since I was the first one to respond to his listing he sold it to me for even less. I couldn’t believe it, 150k miles and detailed service records, dude was meticulous. The guy in question was an obviously wealthy person who had the car sitting around for months because his daughter had moved, so apart from one or two small rust spots the body is in great shape. I’ll eventually detail it. We test drove it and I bought it.

NOW with that out of the way I want to make this thing my gem. Headlight restoration tips would be appreciated, or is it worth it to just buy the halo ones? Are those compatible? I know the factory ones are halogen. 

So the main problem. This just started, wasn’t this way when I first bought the car, but...the rpm’s are messed up, the idle is rough (keeps skittering between 500 and 1200 whenever I’m stopped) and actually if I’m stopped for too long the car stalls. Another symptom *was* that I would turn the key in the ignition and stop, like you’re supposed to, and the engine would start up and immediately die. I had to hold the key in the start position for an additional few seconds after turning it or the car would die immediately. I actually replaced the air filter and that problem stopped completely which is interesting but the main problem of rough rpms remains. 

Check engine codes:
P0313
P1345
P0171
P0174
P0444

I saw elsewhere online on some forum that codes p0171 and p0174, (which both are “system too lean” codes, which I guess means too much air in the fuel) point to the Mass Airflow Sensor. Is that accurate? Also read that a clogged EGR valve would cause those symptoms so I bought the tools and I’m doing that tomorrow, but I had to figure out how to get in the engine today. 

Sorry I know this is long, the sub is smaller so hopefully this isn’t too much at one time. Just wondering if anyone has any pointers since this is an e46 specific forum. Thanks a lot! ",e46,1554330455,NorcoXO,41,17,True,2019-04-03

Wheel specs for '04 325i sedan,"I've been looking into wheels for my 325i, specifically Apex ARC-8's (I know, very original). Here's the part where it gets fun.

I have no concern about the rear, at least after a fender roll, but the front is where concerns arise.

Then it came to me, a week ago when replacing my DISA valve i notice the pin is missing that holds that flap.

2003 325xi dead instrument cluster,"This just happened today.

Left and right turn signals don't show anything on the dash, but they are working, as is all the other exterior lighting.

The radio and climate controls are working, but the time on the radio shows --:-- as I assume the time comes from the instruments.  Windows, locks and other interior lighting works as well.

Timing chain noise - should it be replaced?,"Now the US users probably won't know too much about this issue because it concerns the 316i and 318i engines, namely N42 and N46 (my engine).

These engines are notorious for timing chain issues. EU forums are full of people who had theirs snap/jump at as low as 50k km. My engine has done 163k km (bit over 100k Miles) and sometimes I can hear the chain grind on a cold start. It doesn't happen every time, only about 50% of cold starts and it goes away in under 1,5 seconds. I already installed the upgraded tensioner BMW provides months before the noise started just to be sure. 

I rang up my local mechanic who wanted at least €1k for the repair, more like €1,5k, which is nearly the value of the car.

e46 coupe exhaust,"Hi   
Currently I own an e46 320ci m sport. Very happy with it and all, great car. However I want more of an audible presence in the form of an exhaust. The engine is an m54b22. Looking around I find very few exhausts that claim to fit my 320ci, and most of the ones that do show images and diagrams for a single pipe system, which mine is not being a 6 cylinder engine. From looking at bmw diagrams I am at a conclusion where I believe my exhaust system is the same as that on other 6 cylinder e46's such as the 330ci (part numbers seem to match), MINUS the backbox, as the larger engine cars have the butterfly valve in the backbox. So it stands to reason that potentially I could use an exhaust for a 330ci in my 320ci? Anyone have any experience on this and can advise? My other thought is to get a custom exhaust made as then I have the best chance of getting the exhaust sound I desire.

I CANNOT find my EGR valve!,"Hi guys. So this is really weird to me. I have an 03 325xi. I’ve been having symptoms that could point a few places but with 150k miles on it I think the EGR valve is one of the more likely culprits. So I have everything I need to remove it and to clean it. Only problem is I can’t find it for the life of me. 

[this](http://www.bmwcoop.com/2016/05/24/change-egr-thermostat-e46-bmw-3-series-diy/) link is an example of what you’ll find if you google “e46 EGR valve removal.” There are several others that I’ve gone carefully through and read too and it’s the same for every single one of these guides - the engine bay is not the same as mine. In the link above you can see the EGR valve is easily accessible after taking the engine covers off (I know the article is about changing the EGR thermostat but you can still clearly see the valve in the pics). 

There’s two covers. One is covering the back (the one with the oil cap) and one is more at the front. Instead, mine has two covers that are side by side instead of front to back. In other words [here](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uNZG6uXT17Q/maxresdefault.jpg) is what mine looks like. 

Why is every single guide I find using cars with that different engine bay? I can’t figure out how it translates into where things are on my engine bay. Since every e46 specific EGR tutorial is like this I’ve had no luck finding the EGR. The place where it is in all the tutorials is where my air filter is. Anyone have any insight?

- Castrol website's says I should buy Castrol EDGE 0W-30 A5/B5
- I can see there is also CASTROL EDGE TITANIUM FST, C3, 5W-30 that exists but it is C3 not A3/B3
- I can also order CASTROL GTX, A3/B4, 5W-40.

"Huge issue with car, seems unfixable?","Car decided after going shopping to completely go brick status. It would bog down and refuse to idle. Brand new fuel pump, spark plugs, filters, clean MAF, new transmission (worth noting it won't shift properly to neutral)

Replaced all relevant fuses and relays.  Here's a list of codes that my usual mechanic pulled. They weren't able to fix the car so it's at a BMW dealership waiting for the service dept to open.  Anyways here's those codes:

100 ECU Self Test

37 Switching delay main relay

217 CAN: EGS Signal

36 Main relay

69 Fuel Pump relay

126 DMTL: Magnetic Valve Circuit

53 Idle Speed Actuator Open Coil

27 Idle Speed Actuator Closed Coil 

74 A/C Compressor Control

124 Actuator Variable Intake System - Valve

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously at a loss for what it could be. I originally thought fuses and relays but we replaced nearly everything electronic.

When waiting for the tow truck I got it to fire up once and then it bogged and stalled. The shop installed another brand new fuel pump as well free of charge just to make sure. Second attempt while waiting for the tow truck it fired up, immediately backfired out of the intake (or at least sounded like it ) and electronic smelling smoke came out of what I think was the DISA valve, but since it took me a few seconds to go around and look it could have been from under that. 

Any theories guys? I do not want to write this car off with as much time effort and money I've dumped into it. ",e46,1546209438,QbertTK,9,1,True,2018-12-30

I recently bought the 2001 325ci since it was in better mechanical shape than the 2000 328i for a price i had to impulsively buy from a friend.

I got it out, but the threads are gone. 

I can't bore it out to rethread because of the angle. I even took it off the motor mounts, put it on a hoist bar, and angled it as much as possible. There was no way. 

Instead, I decided to mate it back up and try a cap head screw inserted backwards (from motor to trans). It won't clear because the cap head is 18mm, but my clearance is closer to 15.4mm. This gives the head a thickness of 1.7mm. If I go less than 15mm, I'll eat into the hex cap's internal socket.

I just need to get by from February to June. I'll take the engine out, and I'll retap it with a helicoil in June, but I don't want to risk damaging the transmission or the engine in the meantime (I removed the oil pan and valve cover, and the engine is gorgeous, so I don't want to damage it).",e46,1546394953,D0gDay,3,1,True,2019-01-01

325ci Electrical Problems,"Hey all,

Need some advice here to see if I need a new cluster or not. My car has been sitting for a few months and ended up deciding to fix it up and start to daily it again. Since it sat for a long time it had been dead for a bit so I charged the battery up and took it out for a spin. No issues there. Sadly the day after I got it back on the road, is when everything started to happen. 

The fun part is the temp needle, RPM and Speed needles all maxed out and stayed in place. The LCD screen at the bottom didnt work and I had a beautiful display of every color of every light on. I then disconnected the battery and let it sit to release any power left behind. Set everything back up and it works just fine. Next day in the morning, it happens again. I checked all the fuses and nothing. Turn the key to position 2 and then the Speed needles doesn't work, temp and RPM needle max out and so does the gas gauge. Bottom LCD doesnt work.

Figured it might be the battery so I replace that and end up leaving the positive and negative undone over night and even touched the leads together to also release any left behind power. Put it all together and works just fine only for the next day for the same thing to happen. This time the needles freak out and the LCD reads PPPPP. ended up taking the fuses out for the cluster and fixes all the issues.

This goes on for a few days like this and im left with taking the fuses out to fix the cluster. I even read that the cluster might have some moisture in it, so I took it out and let it sit inside on one of my heater vents to dry out over night.

But wait theres more! For a bit of time now, ive also had an issue with the driver side taillight saying its out but the left brake bulb is brighter than anything on the rear. The bulb on the left works but the one of the right doesnt. Everything works just fine aside from those two bulbs.

Question about E60 shift lever swap / drive shaft clearance,"[Maybe 2mm clearance? Metal part is the circlip](https://imgur.com/MJ5O1V3)

Dropped the exhaust and drive shaft yesterday to do a total shifter rebuild and noticed the upon reassembly the E60 shift lever sits INSANELY close to the drive shaft. I didn't check clearances prior to this with the stock lever and I noticed the E60 lever sits a little bit lower, but this looks too tight. Feels like it's about 2mm of clearance tops. 

Dudes with E60 shifters in their five speed cars, do you know how close the gap is supposed to be between the shifter rod and the drive shaft?

I guess since they're both bolted to the transmission and they're so close they should never have a reason to contact each other right? Like there's no reason there should ever be opposing forces acting on the drive shaft and the rod. I can row through all the gears and reverse and not hear or feel anything weird going on.

Read that it's probably the expansion tank so I ordered one and going to attempt DIY bought this as a temp beater but need it to last a bit longer. Any other ideas in case it's not that?

Changing E46 Key,"tldr; Put transponder chip from old key to new 

&amp;#x200B;

So, not sure if this is the right place for this but here goes. I have a 2001 330Ci, the key is pretty busted and currently works with tape holding it together. So I got a new key off eBay, and had it cut so it matches. I did the whole hold unlock/lock to set up the buttons on the key, and it now works BUT it does not start the car.

&amp;#x200B;

I know there are transponder chips in keys which is like a little black thing which sends a radio signal to the ignition when the key is inserted which ofc my new one does not have. Seeing as my old key is busted, my thought is that i'll just move the transponder from the old to the new and job done. But I can't for the life of me see where this chip is? I've opened up the key and nothing falls out, there are a few different chips soldered to the board. Is it one of them? If so, what can I do?

Im currently working on building my E46 drift car and I'm having an issue where my front passengers side tire is rubbing on the inner wall. Im using stock wheels currently.

"""The chainguide""","After 3 happy years of cruising everywhere in my 316ti compact and performing some basic maintenance a more severe problem came up when driving from The Netherlands to my girlfriend in Belgium. It started with the oil pressure warning light blinking after I accelerated from a traffic light. It was just a tiny blink. Barely enough to notice. So I thought it must have been some movement of the oil in the carter. No biggy. Sadly, this kept happening. Every time the traffic light went green and I drove off the light blinked. I already had a Check Engine warning for my catalyst so I wasn't sure if anything new had shown up. I stopped at a parking lot, plugged in my OBD Bluetooth adapter and was surprised to see a P0012 (timing over retarded). This couldn't be good. I rang up a local mechanic that was praised on the Belgium bimmerboard forum to give his professional advise. He immediately told me it probably was the chainguide that supports and tensions the distribution chain. It's expected to break sometime in the lifespan of the engine, causing the plastic bits to clog the Carter oil canal. This in turn drops the oil pressure which causes the light to blink. Now that wouldn't be a really big operation, if only the chain didn't stretch. But it did. After getting towed by my father in laws Tesla Model X (hilarious sight btw. A BMW getting towed by a Tesla. Imagine.) the mechanic could take a look inside. 

The offer: €1000-1200. 
This would include a replacement of the following parts:
* new chain
* tensioner
* chain guide
* crankshaft sprocket
* head gasket
* oil filter housing gasket (was leaking some oil)
* lots of hours

I decided to let him do the repair. The car currently has 207.000km on the clock so it should take me from a to b for another 100k. 
The car will be done tomorrow evening. Fingers crossed. 

I hope this will be of any help to some of you having the same issue.

Basically I started it up, and immediately noticed it was running a little bit rough - revs were fine and steady as per but there was an unusual engine vibration. Wait a little while and it fades a bit. I put it into drive and add a little gas and the engine runs rough, rpm drop and it stalls on me.

Car has about 122,000km on it. There is a minor oil leak from the rocker cover gasket and I'm wondering if that has buggered the spark plugs and coils? Other than that it has been running like clockwork. 

Any hot takes on this issue? Could this be a pricey repair? Will be phoning the mechanic tomorrow, but likely won't be getting looked at as this is a long weekend in my region of New Zealand.

Is a well-kept M3 worth going for?,"So long story short, I’ve had a 2001 330Ci for a little while now, doing the assorted maintenance and all. It’s been fun and i love it but as most people can probably relate, I’ve always eyed up an e46 M3. 

Recently my reverse has gone out but the other gears still function normally and it’s an automatic. I’ve been quoted roughly $2k-$2.5k for a replacement job at my local shop and I’m rather apprehensive on whether i should just sell the car and move on or go through with this.

Honestly, I’d be comfortable upgrading as I’ve got a couple local M3s with decent mileage through dealers locally that’ll have warranties. BUT I’ve also considered just holding onto the 330Ci and doing a manual swap which will obviously be more expensive but potentially more responsible in the long run.

Guys! Just got my first genuine E46 problem. Its the FSR/FSU and/or blower. Question now:," - On the FSR, which pin is the full power blower?
 - If I set an outside wire to go from that pin directly to the output, so that when its set to full power it just pulls from the outside wire, will this cause a problem?
 Note; the idea is when it fails again, when I set to full the wire will still send juice to the output, so I can still defog the windows even if the damn thing is knackered. Sort of a bypass.

 - On another note: if one were to strip one of those things and apply a straight fixed resistance to each setting - and none to the full power one - would it work?",e46,1548108472,Tuga_Lissabon,2,1,True,2019-01-21

Got caught by surprised with oversteer for the first time,"First day of rain in a while, at a curved ""merging lane"" overtaking a Yaris, when suddenly I feel the rear end loose and my automatic 98 328i starts pointing towards the wall. At this point I'm shitting my pants but instinctively start to counter steer, slowly ease off the throttle but the car keeps aiming at the wall, ready for the worse I accept my fate and ask why ASC didn't even then  on once. After a bit my counter steer and throttle management pays off and the car starts to straighten and I'm safe.

After the incident I was both terrified and amazed at what just happened, when I got home I just kept imagining how it looked like from the guys behind me and the guy I was overtaking I bet it was awesome but still terrifying none the less. I can't even imagine how lucky I was that the automatic gearbox didn't decide to shift and completely fuck my acceleration while oversteering.

My dad's similar E46 328i has DSC rather than ASC and I understand how some people say it's too intrusive or that it's training wheels but damn it can still be a huge help in unexpected situations like these(and it has!

Rear Wheel bearing Replacement - $540???,"
Took my ‘04 330i to a shop to take a look at my car because I suspected a bearing to be shot.

The shop determined it was the rear passanger wheel bearing and also noticed i needed my front control arm bushings replaced. 

Was quoted approximately $800- $1000 for the whole job.

Came back and let them know I only want the rear wheel bearing replaced (will do bushings myself) and he is quoting me $540 
Not too sure... but that seems outrageous.

He said the job will take “most of the day”
and that he needed to take it to a machine shop for some reason which adds on an extra $80 to the charge ??? then mumbled something about “try to save you money if we can do it inhouse”


aside from that, I paid $125 for diagnostics and was told that it would pay towards the job... but now he’s telling me that’s only if i got the bushings done as well.

Can someone let me know if this is an expected cost.

Replacing front bumper on 2004 330 'vert,"Soooooo . . . I've made bad parking decisions one or two times too many and the front bumper on my 2004 330 'vert came a bit loose. I took it to my regular shop (NOT a body shop) and they tightened it back up, mostly but not completely. That was a year ago. Now it is becoming separated again, slightly. I remember at the time that my mechanic told me not to bump any more parking barriers because there wasn't any more space to tighten up the bumper with---no more space to apply screws or some such. 

So my question is, now that the bumper is coming loose again:

Am I 100% screwed or can I take it to a body shop and just replace the whole thing? Or will even a new bumper not rectify the problem of there not being ""space"" to screw it down?

I'd ask the body shops in my town, of course, but I just moved and don't know of any reputable shops. (There isn't even a shop here that works on German cars!)

2003 330Ci Electrical Issues,"Car has had a history of intermittently working headlights. For the past year there were a few times when headlights would randomly stop working (showing indicator on the cluster) either one at a time or both. After some time, could be a few minutes to a few days, the headlights would start working again. 

Then one day noticed that left headlight would always go out whenever it rained; in the past 2 or 3 months, the left headlight has been out and hasn't come back on. A bit after that, the electrical flickering began. Whenever the car was started and whenever the headlights were turned on the indicators on the dash cluster would flicker and I would hear an electrical buzzing sound through my speakers. [Here's an example of what happens.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSqCY6PB_H0) Yesterday, during rain the right headlight went out as well and hasn't come back on.

Other electrical issues:

* Unlocking car with key, passenger side lock remains locked 30% of the time. Sometimes I have to unlock from the inside. Other times, relocking and unlocking again with key works.
* Left side xenon bulb dimmed to yellowish/cream white color (used to be a bright white/blue). Right side is still bright white/blue.",e46,1548868003,gunthug,7,1,True,2019-01-30

Floor soaking wet behind driver's(left side) seat,"I got a 98 E46 328i without sunroof that gets the floor of the left side rear seats soaking wet (I'm sure there's a puddle in there...) when it's raining.

* Not from A/C since water appears with the car stopped for a while

E46 316 to 330 conversion questions/help," I've recently moved back to Europe from the UK and took my E46 330CI RHD with me. The engine and suspension is all good on her but the body work is rusted all around and therefore not worth importing and reregistering. 

My original idea was to to fit the 330 engine in my E36 316 LHD but after having taken apart both cars entirely I discovered that converting the wiring harness would be too much hassle as I wanted to have all the luxury of the E46 in my E36. I've put the E36 back together and was thinking of buying a LHD E46 for €1000 or less with one condition only that the bodywork is in a mint condition. 

Most e46's that are available are 316 &amp; 318. Does anyone know if I can plug the 330 engine wiring straight into a 316 wiring harness and do other things just plug in to the harness as well (like the DSC module and the drive by wire pedalbox) or will I have to rewire? If I could I would've put the whole 330 harness over but because it's a RHD the fuse box is on the wrong site and wires are either too long or too short.

To make things even more complicated, my 330 is a coupe, could I fit the engine, exhaust, propshaft, diff and brakes onto a sedan or station or are parts different there?

"320d (150bhp) cold start issue, advice welcome","Hoping someone can chime in with any advice regarding my problem, I’ve seen quite a few forum posts online which sound like it’s the same issue but can’t find anything conclusive 

I have an 04’ 320d which is having trouble starting especially when cold. I have a fault code stored for the glow plug module/relay which I’ve ordered and should be arriving soon but I’m not sure that’s the culprit 

The engine will crank but not fire 70% of the time when cold, I have to cycle the ignition on and off at least 5 or 6 times before it will fire, it usually takes until around the 5 time until I can hear the fuel pump(?) priming and then it will fire up with no issues. Sometimes if I’ve recently used my car and the temp gauge is in the blue (cold but not stone cold) still it won’t fire, which makes me think it wouldn’t be a glow plug issue because the engines still warm. But I’m not entirely sure as I’ve always had petrol e46s previously so this is new to me


Also I’d say that every 1/5 times that I put my key into position 2 the temp gauge shoots straight the red even if cold, could this be related? I’ve read that this is a sign of a failing DDE or DME or whatever it’s called 

I really don’t want to start throwing money at fuel pumps and stuff if it’s not that that needs replacing, apart from the occasional time when the temp jumps to the red and my engine is warm it’ll have no issues starting

"I rebuilt the VANOS on my 03 325i, but still have the same problem.","I bought my car 2 years ago with 140,XXX miles on it. It now has 175,XXX miles. Ever since I bought it it had the usual hesitation and surging between 2500-3000 rpm when I'd give it half or more throttle regardless of what gear I was in (5 speed manual). Other than that the engine ran fine. It also has trouble starting sometimes. If it's a cold morning and it's been sitting all night then it will start immediately. If I've been driving a while and it's warmed then it will also start immediately if I shut it off. If I start it up in the morning on a warm day then it will crank for as long as about 10 seconds, but will always start. Anyway I figured the problem was the VANOS piston seals. I rebuilt the VANOS and have put almost 1000 miles on it since then, but I still have the exact same problem. The only difference now is I can tell the low end power has improved a little. Has anyone else had the same issue? I've read in some forums that it may be some tuning issue where the ECU needs an update. 

Oh and one more thing. On really hot days if I've been driving for a while, when I come to a complete stop I have to give it more throttle than usual when taking off because it will stall sometimes if I don't. It has never done that on cold days no matter how long I've been driving. I don't know if these two problems could be related. ",e46,1549230783,you_had_me_at_meh,13,1,True,2019-02-03

New e46 owner!,"Hi! Just wanted to introduce myself to this sub as I plan on spending more time here! I will be taking over my dads e46 in a week and a half ish. He mentioned there’s a lot of work he’s getting done on it before I pick it up, but I definitely don’t have any plans of keeping it stock. 

Got a few quick questions I hope you guys can answer! 

1. Is it ok to stick led bulbs into halogen housing?
2. Are Koni yellows and h&amp;r sport springs the best option? And how much does that typically run you?
3. Any good shops in Orange County ca? I’m not too handy myself and don’t have a garage!
4. Having some issues with my key unlocking and locking the car. My dad mentioned something about the receiver being in the rear view mirror housing? (Reason he thinks this is because he has attempted the trick? Where you start the car and then hold the keys and then tap a certain key 3 times) has anyone here swapped out the housing to fix the remote issue?

Thanks for the read!

Average mpg dropped from 22 to 19 after new wheels and tires.,"I didn't think it would make such a difference. I went from 17"" style 68s with some 5-6 year old tires to 18"" ZHP rims with firehawk indy 500s. Car has more a lot more traction but it feels slower now. It slows down faster than before after lifting foot off the throttle. My rpms are also a bit higher than before. I regret switching lol. I can't exactly switch back since I bought new tires. Only benefit is aesthetics. Tire psi was lower previously too. When I had the 17s
my psi was around 28 all around when I checked, so I wasn't exactly getting optimal mpg. Now with the 18s they are 32F/36R. I may bump up the rear a bit to 38. Any advice?

Winter tire advice.,"So I just purchased four new Michelin Premier A/S tires. They are great, however we have some snowy weather coming up for the next week or two here in Oregon.

I fly out of PDX on the 12th and return on the 18th. We are supposed to get 12-18 inches of snow in that time. I'll need to drive ~50 miles on highways to get home on the 18th.

Is is better to put my two studded tires on the rear or stick with the all-seasons?

There seems to be a lot of fear mongering about this, I wonder how much is due to tire companies making more money if you buy 2 vs 4 tires.

Aside from understeer issues, which could be surprising and dangerous in a vehicle typically prone to oversteer, more traction is always better than less right?

Unfortunately I just bought tires and don't really want to spend more. The February car budget is used up.

Sunroof Cassette - Coupe vs. Sedan,"The sunroof in my '02 325iT has taken a dump. I already bought the parts to repair the slider but I recently found a full cassette assembly  out of an '04 M3. This sunroof would have the updated shade sliders, would also have a black shade that would compliment the interior project I'll be doing, and is also ever-so-slightly lighter by almost half a Kg lol.

Here's the research that I've gathered so far:
- '02 Touring Cassette PN: 54138246024
- '04 M3 Cassette PN: 54137134536
- '04 Touring Cassette PN: 54137134535

The difference between the '02 Touring cassette and the '04 Touring cassette is the shade slider design; the rest of the parts are pretty much identical down to the part number. So that tells me that the '04 Touring cassette is compatible with the '02. Now I'll look at comparing the '04 Coupe and '04 Touring cassettes.

The differences between these two are minimal. The glass between a coupe and sedan have different PNs and the sedan has a rain gutter. All other part numbers are identical, minus the water drain hoses which shouldn't affect the unit itself and are different due to the chassis shape.

Now wrapping everything back together, here's my question. In theory, If I take the sedan glass and rain gutter (same PN between '02 and '04 tourings) and bolt it into coupe cassette assembly, everything should line up and bolt in. Has anyone dared try this before? If not, I'll be the first and try my best to document my findings.",e46,1549989559,formattedlizard,1,1,True,2019-02-12
Help diagnosing possible fuel leak 2004 320i,"Hey guys, first post here asking for advice about my car. I drive a 2004 320i, I've had it for about a year and a bit and it's always been solid to me except for the occasional rad blowout (fixed now, thankfully.) 2 days ago I went to the local gas station and filled up with premium 91 octane fuel, and I added some STP super concentrated injector cleaner to the tank as well in an effort to improve cold starts in chilly Northern Ontario, as well as to absorb some of the possible moisture accumulating in my tank and lines. After this fill up I found I was using WAY more fuel than normal. Like I usually get about 550 km's of city driving on a full tank and so far I don't know if I've even driven 75km on the first quarter gone from full. It seems like if I step on it I can almost see the gas gauge go down in real time :( 

Is it possible I've created some sort of fuel leak by adding the STP concentrated fuel injector cleaner by some weird stroke of unluck? Also looking for common locations of fuel leaks so I can take a look around and see if it's been pissing gas out of the line or something somewhere. I haven't changed anything else on the car except for just adding the STP injector cleaner since this happened so I don't really know what else could be the cause, unless it was just a coincidental line rupture. If anyone has any ideas or suggestions they'd absolutely go a long way!

Should I replace my Head gasket?,"Hey guys,

So, basically I own a e46 316i with around 180k km. (bought it at 170k km).

I'm planning to bring my bimmer to my local garage for a head gasket replacement because of the issues I'm having right now. No compression test has been done so there haven't been any diagnosis.   
The price of this replacement is estimated at 800-1000 euros. Which in my opinion isn't a rip off and the guy always keeps it close to the estimated prices. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm still wondering if this will actually fix my problems.   


**The last 2 months the following has been done to my bimmer:**  
\- New CCV  
\- New Exhaust mounts   
\- New Coolant pipes...  
\- Lambda sensors has been replaced as well.   
\- Timing chain

&amp;#x200B;

**The following issues are still remaining after the changes:**

\- High oil consumption (1l refill every 200\~300km)  
\- Coolant looks a little brownish and I have to refill every now and then.  
*(!Few months ago my garage told me that he cleaned some white/mayo remains and found some water/oil in it)*  
\- A weird buzzing/vibration sound when accelerating ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp1bmgIuwWk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp1bmgIuwWk))  
\- There seems to be a loss of power ranging from 2000-3000rpm  
\- White smoke  
\- Burned smell when outside the car. It smells like plastic but also oil? not sure.

  
According to the above symptoms. **Do you think that everything has to do with the head gasket?** I really would LOVE to get this thing rolling smoothly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any tips?

https://streamable.com/3a1ss

Can’t really understand what is going on. There is annoying rattle when idling, and when engine is semi cold. When RPM increases, sound disappears, if engine is warmed up after driving a bit, also it is gone. 


If engine is warmed up, and there is a load, such as pulling of traffic lights, then there is a bit of this rattle, but, as load decreases, noise as well.


https://streamable.com/bsrai


The second video is fuel cutoff at high revs, you can hear as rpms are rapidly decreasing, and once after it stopped, around 1s constantly you can hear this whining-rattle. Doesn’t matter cold or hot, it constantly repeats and at same interval after shutdown. (Is EMU trying to control some hardware after shutdown?)
Doesn’t really matter if wheel is fully turned or not, once engine is hot, noise disappears.


Thanks for ideas! ",e46,1550438271,Internet_Exploiter,5,5,True,2019-02-17
Dumb question about A/c belt,"Will my car drive fine if I cut the fucker off? The belt is dry rotted to hell and back, but I couldn’t get the tensioner free when I tried to replace it. It’ll be a week or so for the new one to ship out and I’m tired of this loud whistling scream that is coming from it. My ears are bleeding and I can’t stand another day of it.


Also, is there any reason not to upgrade to hydraulic tensioners? Could only find stuff about M3s using them but mine is a 325xi. Looks like they are interchangable",e46,1550446377,darkflash26,4,7,True,2019-02-17
Im tired of my e46 (HELP),"I'm 17 years old almost done with school and I own a 325i E46 2004 sport package blue steptronic and I'm slowly starting to hate it.
So basically my dad found this super clean E46 for a Great deal and bought it
When I first saw the car I've kind of liked it bcz it's a bimmer and btw I don't have a license (u get a license when you become 18) but anyways my dad told me the car is mine and I will be having it for a while. At first I didn't have a single problem but after driving it for 6 months it's becoming a pain in the ass.
I drove it to school and here and there but the thing is I'm always fixing this piece of shit like fucking always I can't explain how mad i am
My brother works at BMW so he fix my car 
I just took my back muffler and my cats and now it sounds amazing with pops
In one month I changed: spark plugs, CCV, engine gasket, tires and wheels (tires were dead and the wheels were too heavy and scratched a bit, m3 steering wheel (the msport was peeling off and color was fading and I got the m3 one for 100$), rear suspension mounts and it needs more 
I need to change to change my engine valve because it's using a lot of oil and smoking and I need to change my rear suspension and fuck ton of stuff

The thing is I love E46 and as a petrolhead I respect it but this car is fucking me up 
I'm planned to sell it and buy a cleaner a 330ci but after this I lost hope in BMW.
I'm getting a Nissan 370z when I get my license bcz my brother owns a g35 and it never breaks down and it's really cheap and  easy to fix and getting rid this crap

PS: I really take care of the car and I drive normally but it's just bmw's man they are so fucking complicated and they really have bad systems

Electric Radiator Fan Woes,"Happy President's Day to US Members!

I'm trying to diagnose a radiator fan issue with my '02 325i 5-speed and would love some input from my fellow e46 owners. I work on the car myself and I'm not sure what the problem is from my own search.

**Here's what happened:**  
Took a 30-minute highway drive, and *(not sure what prompted me, maybe my BMW-sense was tingling)* I pulled up the Coolant Temp on the OBC menu. It read 96C, which concerned me because it is usually 88C when cruising. Read my codes and got a thermostat code, so I thought it was a stuck thermostat and replaced it.

The day after that, it was still running hot, and I notice the fan wasn't running. The bottom hose was warm, telling me the new thermostat is working. I turned on the AC and it spun at 10% but didn't speed up.

• I replaced the lower hose Coolant Temp Sensor, but it gave no change.  
• I'm very confident the system is properly bled, but I could be wrong.  
• Got a junkyard fan, and I get the same behavior.  
• I can run the fan from 10-90% through the test mode in INPA.

**Question Time:**

Is it possible to have a bad fan controller, but still have the fan respond to testing via INPA? (Sounds dumb, but I need reassurance)

Alpina E46 models in Canada?,"I have a 2004 BMW 325i Touring RWD manual car that has suffered through 14 winters of abuse and road salt. I dearly love my car and hope it keeps going but I suspect there will come a day that I will have to replace it.

Realizing my car is 15 years old reminded me that Canada's car import limit is 15 years, meaning cars may be freely imported, for the most part, once they are 15 years old. I did this importing an E30 cab several years ago from the US.

This made me think of the Alpina models that are likely sitting in Europe that are now 15 years old and are E46 models.

Is anyone familiar with E46 Alpinas? How serviceable are they in North America? Are most parts exchangeable on the consumable side (brakes, suspension, oil filters, etc.) How about reliability?

"Dropped Oil Pan, Found Plastic. Any Ideas?","I dropped the oil pan on my 2004 330i ZHP, and I found a couple ""extras"" in the corner.

&amp;#x200B;

The first is black plastic, and it's curved. I completed the curve with a compass. If it's a broken piece of a circle, the inner diameter of that circle would be: 15mm. The outer diameter would be 17mm. It has no numbers/letters/images, but it does have a tab on the top that reminds me of a safety tab on a child-proof bottle cap.

&amp;#x200B;

The second is black plastic, and it's curved. I repeated the compass trick, and it's I.D. would be 22mm. O.D. would be 23mm. It's thin. It has half of the BMW logo, and after the logo the number ""7"" is raised on it. The logo and stamp are on the I.D.

&amp;#x200B;

The third is black plastic, and it's curved. I repeated the compass trick, and the I.D. is 22mm. Strangely, the raised number I found on this piece is on the O.D., and it's the number ""1.""

&amp;#x200B;

The last piece is black plastic, and it's too tiny to determine a curve. It has a raised letter on it, and it's either a lowercase ""b"" or a ""q."" I find this odd, since most BMW parts are in capital letters.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas where these parts came from? My thoughts were timing chain components, but those are opaque grey? There's not a lot of hard, solid, black plastic inside the engine. Definitely not the dipstick tube; that's metal. I don't think any rubber would turn as rigid yet not brittle as these pieces.

"04 325ci No Crank No Start, need some help","So I just did the CCV and Oil filter housing gasket. Between school and work, It took me about 2 weeks to do in my driveway. I had my battery disconnected for the entirety of the time. 

On Saturday when I went to start the car for the first time, it was weak and hesitant but did start. Car ran great, no vacuum leak and no signs of oil immediately leaking from the oil filter housing. I drove the car around all day Saturday and noticed that every time I would go to start the car it sounded off and weak. 

Yesterday morning I went out to the food store, started the car and it again sounded weak and hesitant. I figured what the hell, might as well drive it anyways. As I was leaving the food store, I got the no crank no start. All electronics work, headlights work and do not dim. Tried jumping it and still nothing. 

Towed it back to the driveway, tested the battery 11.98 V

I watched this video, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1T7u70rog0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1T7u70rog0) and the guy said any reading under 12v could be a problem. 

Could a low/bad battery cause these issues?  I'm thinking no because it won't take a jump. Yes I'm hooking up to the right terminals.

Or is it more likely the starter from these symptoms?

Also anyone have a recommendation of how in the hell I should get my voltage meter or test light on the starter positive terminal without ripping out the intake manifold again.

Thoughts on aftermarket head units.,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for some thoughts and advice on my head unit situation. First and foremost, **the tl;dr of this post is ""*****I want a new head unit in my M3, but I have some concerns. Should I do it? And if so, which head unit should I buy?*****""**

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the meat... My 2002 M3 came with their navigation system and onboard computer. The DVD was missing when I acquired the vehicle, so right now the screen is basically just there to look (kind of) pretty, although BMW has told me that they can get me a DVD with current maps that will work with the old system which is good news because I really want on-board navigation. It's still a bit of a drag though because of the music situation. There is no bluetooth or aux input and while BMW does make an aux input for under $40 that can be installed behind the head unit... it is only compatible cars built from 09/02 and mine was built in 11/01 so that's a no-go.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now, I am running a high-end FM transmitter which plugs into the cigarette lighter and also charges my phone (and that part is pretty cool and useful)... BUT I am ALSO running a radar detector and that too plugs into the cigarette lighter for power! The result is that I've had to get one of those bit ugly boxes that plugs into the one lighter port and gives you two ports. Convenient... but fat and ugly. This whole set up also means I have three different kinds of wires hanging out all around my center controls... one to the FM tuner, one from the tuner, and one to the radar detector and I hate it. I've done the best I can to wrap some of them around the steering column to take up less space, and I plan on tying the others up with twisty ties, but I really don't like this solution nor the situation at large.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I am considering is having a new head unit installed.** One with bluetooth and Apple CarPlay (because I'm an iOS user), and getting an e46 bezel to fit the unit and match it to the rest of the dash. **But I have my concerns**. If I do this, I would of course save the original head unit but **I am worried about what it would do to the value of the car in the long run.** *I am also concerned about losing the on-board computer. I am a big believer in keeping valuable cars as original as possible* (I think its so sad every time I see an e46 M3 that's been gutted and decked out in all sorts of aftermarket crap... to me it feels like the car equivalent of a pretty woman whose had way too much plastic surgery done and leaves you shaking your head asking *""Why did you do that to yourself?*"" Only in this case, the car has no say in the matter, which is even more sad).

&amp;#x200B;

Next question is **if I were to put in a new head unit, what kind should I go with**? I don't know much about sound systems, but I do know that **I don't want to spend a crap-ton of money**. *I'd be looking to spend* ***around \~$300 on the unit*** *plus whatever the installation would run me*. I also know that I would want one that is compatible with Apple's CarPlay because if I'm going to update my vehicle's navigation and entertainment system, I want to be able to pair it with my phone and get instant access to Apple Music, iMessage, and Maps.

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think? Should I go for it? Does anybody have any experience with installing a new HU in their e46, particularly an M3... DIY or installed by a shop. Would you do it again? And any suggestions on a good unit?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance everybody! Happy driving :)

Springs Vs Coil overs,"Money is always a factor so I won’t pretend that it’s not. But I wanna lower my car because I feel like it just sits too high. I’m not trying to stance it but just like 1” or 2” would be perfect. 90% of the time I’m the only one in the car so ride comfort isn’t a major concern.  

With that being said I’m torn between springs or coils. I know coils are cheaper but what problems come with them? And is 150$ too low for springs? And coils is it true that anything under 500$ isn’t worth it? I don’t have much experience personally with it so what are your thoughts? Thanks.  ",e46,1541449071,LODSlender17,9,1,True,2018-11-05
Lower intake boot - clamp installed upside down?!,"Hi there,

Been running lean in the old girl, and went to examine/replace the intake boot(s) and possibly the DISA o ring, since the MAF was working  and was cleaned, and the fault codes persisted.

Got the upper boot off fine, only to find some clown installed the pipe clamp to the idle upside down?!?

I have NO idea how it was tightened on, as it seems to high up to access from under the engine, and it's not loose enough to have slipped/rotated.

Any ideas or suggestions on how to access it? I was thinking of cutting it off, but I'd still be hard pressed to loosen the clamp. (Best laid plans...) ",e46,1541521590,tourima,9,1,True,2018-11-06

Help with Head Unit Troubles,"Hey Guys,

I've spent the past weekend installing an Avin Avant 3 in my new to me E46 M. However I am having some trouble getting the sound to work.

I have an 03.5 with factory nav and HK. I've routed the antenna cable, the GPS cable and the ""6M extension"" cable from my trunk to my dash. Everything works in terms of GPS, WiFi, steering wheel controls, and all the doo-dads, but I'm not consistently getting sound.

On the trunk end I have the 6M plugged into the 40 Pin adapter, receiving the OEM connector. And on the dash end I have the 6M plugged into the adapter which is the main harness for the Avin unit.

Here's the kicker: I went for a short ride yesterday and when I sat down in the car the sound was working, although there was some static/white noise going on. I sat in the lot for 10 minutes and played with it, listening to music and then went for a ride. Basically immediately once the car started moving the sound started cutting in and out. After 15 minutes I pulled over and sat in another parking lot where the sound was working again for a solid 10 minutes (over bluetooth, native spotify app on the unit, radio). And then when I fired the car back up to go back home the sound was completely dead as it had been when I tested it over the weekend.

So at this point I know all the hardware is working, but there is a snag somewhere in my setup. Unfortunately I'm fairly clueless as far as wiring/electronics goes, but I'm pretty good at following directions so if anyone has any advice I'd be grateful.

Took my car to [BIG NAME] Auto Center and they put green coolant in...,"I have a 2002 BMW 325i and I just went to have my coolant topped off at a big name Auto center, since I work in the store that it's connected to (prior to me finding out there was a leak). Without telling me, it was completely dry, and they added green coolant to it. When in reality it takes BLUE coolant.

Half of it already leaked out, and because I know it's not good to mix coolant, I fixed the leak (two pipes below the manifold), and filled it up with water. So it's approximately 50% green/50% water.

Now, on Monday I will be replacing my cat, so I'm going to drain and do a flush at that time, then fill it with the correct blue coolant, but until then, is it okay to leave that mixture with green+water in there?

I live in California, and the lowest the forecast says it's going to get until Monday is 38°F (~3°C).

From what I heard it won't hurt the car short term, but it may freeze, and I'm not entirely sure what the temperature it freezes at will be. I'm just worried it may freeze overnight or something.

Help Identifying a Hose on e46 318i,"Hi everyone,

I've looked all over for hours and have asked the e46 fanatics forums and still can't get an answer to this (the forums didnt answer). 

On the back of the engine in my 318i (in Australia if this makes a difference), there is a cooling hose connector. The connector goes out of the engine at a right angle, connecting to one medium sized hose that goes back towards the front of the engine bay, and on the top of the connector a smaller hose also connects. 

I am needing to identify the medium sized hose that goes to the front of the engine bay, as it has split from it's clip that connects it to the hose connector on the back of the engine.

Front outer CV boots torn?,"Hey guys,

Driving a 325xi and have recently realized that both of my front outer axle boots are torn, with the joints exposed.

Does anyone know of any reasonable causes for torn axle boots? The car's only got 90k on it and I can't imagine axle boots are a wear item anyway.

white smoke on startup and a rough idle while driving which is also followed by smoke every so often. It's all intermittent, some days its fine others not so much.

How long to wait until flooring it,"Hey all. I apologize greatly if this has already been mentioned 1000 times already. I’m very new to owning an E46, and I’m still trying to learn about them as much as I can. So tonight when I drove home from work (about 2 miles), I turned on the car (119k miles 330ci) and let it idle for about a minute (engine started fully cold). I started driving home making sure not to go full throttle and stayed below 3k rpm. I drove for about 3 mins until something came up. There is this punk ass kid around my age in the area who recently just bought an obnoxiously loud, admittedly clean ‘95 M3 and let me just tell you, this kid drives like a straight dumbass. My friends and I always see him around town doing 65+ and drifting around corners in residential areas. And guess who I happen to pull up next to on this fine evening. That’s right, Douchey McFuckface himself. I hadn’t been driving for too long so I looked at my temp gauge and the needle was just past the first line on the gauge, but I knew I couldn’t let this fat little turd go without a fight. So when the light turned green I said “screw it” and floored that bitch. The pull lasted for a good 20 seconds but me being cautious of my temperature didn’t let it get too high in the rpm’s (maybe 4.5k max). By the time the pull was over my engine had reached fully warm temperatures but it was def not fully warm before. Does this damage the engine? Or am I just tripping? Also I’m curious how long you guys wait until you start gassing your car and getting the rpms up. Thank you for reading and responding.

TLDR: I floored my car before my engine was fully warm (needle was just past the first line on temp gauge) bc I pulled up next to my bitch ass rival. Did I do any damage to my engine? How long do you wait before flooring?",e46,1542699415,MasterHoneydew,16,1,True,2018-11-19

Engine Noise Post CCV Replacement,"Hi, so a month ago I replaced my CCV system with the upgraded cold weather package CCV unit plus associated tubing. Along with the CCV I had to replace:
 - My distribution rail due to breaking it off accidentally
 - Rebuilt my DISA valve (http://www.germanautosolutions.com/product.php?product=115) 
 - Cleaned out my idler control valve and throttle body
 - Replaced my throttle body gasket and intake boot/tubing  

After two days I was finally able to put my engine back together (CCV and the intake boot were by far the hardest parts of putting everything back together). Shortly after I started to hear the buzzing noise that I try to show in the video. I thought it was my DISA valve that was making the noise but after disconnecting it as I did in the video the noise persisted. Any ideas on what the noise could be?

The noise sometimes stops after the car has idled for a while but once I start accelerating the noise comes back.

While cruising at a stable speed, the water temperature gauge drops to the blue field - struggles to get over the first mark while driving uphill or in the city. I thought it was clear - I need to change the thermostat. That's what I did - changed the main one (also, while at it, cleaned the EGR valve, intake manifold, changed the filters, oils - even transmission and differential), changed the coolant, BUT the car is behaving exactly like before.

I've read a lot about the EGR thermostat being faulty also, but it seemed it flows correctly - the hose from the EGR thermostat to the main cooling circuit was cold most of the time, got warm just from time to time. I've ordered it as well, it won't hurt to change it. Could it be the fault?

Also, I've noticed the radiator flaps don't work, the previous owner said he changed the vacuum hoses which didn't help, so I'm suspecting the vacuum valve. This however should just impact the warming speed while driving, not while stationary, and it's obvious that the car is undercooled since the coolant probably always flows through the radiator.

Thank you very much for any suggestions or experience you might have on what else could I do if it wasn't the EGR-stat.",e46,1542788819,filatura,7,1,True,2018-11-21

Radio install = painful,"I just finished swapping out the radio in an e46.

It was a huge pain. My advice as follows.

Plan on taking off the air vents and the heater control below the radio. Once you have the vent and the heater control out remove the screws that hold the frame that contains the radio cage and heater control cage so you can pull it out.

Next move the wiring connector into the cavity on the left side between the steering wheel and radio cavity.

Put the radio in and connect together the connectors by using the vent opening.

I have installed quite a few radios, but the e46 has practically no extra room to work with, it took me a lot longer than I was expecting.",e46,1543095199,sghokie,14,1,True,2018-11-24

Is my e46 haunted?,"The other day when i went to go start my 325ci and upon turning the key, it didn't start but all the lights came on the cluster.

2 strange problems with my old girl,"1) A few nights ago on a very cold night driving home from work I noticed my break lights staying on after I press the peddle.
Cycling the ignition turned them off, and they stayed off until I pressed the break, then they stay on again.
No other lights affected.

The next day, the fairies must have fixed it because the progress gone?


2) every now and then when starting the car I have to tap the accelerator or the car will stall.
Until the engine gets up to temperature the rev needle wobbles like it's about to stall.

Possible past related problems was, Camshaft position sensor and fuel pump.

Fuel pump replaced with 2nd hand part.

How to easily diagnose head gasket / cracked whatever ?,"OK, so over the summer I abruptly started having an overheating issue, temp gauge went high but never went high enough I thought to do anything, but immediately parked it.  I didn't have a ton of time to dig into it but saw the coolant was low so topped it off didn't drive it again for a few months.  Started it to idle etc but gauge never went high again.

Fast forward to November and I started driving it again.  Watched it carefully and never had overheating problems any longer, I thought problem solved.

Friday my oil light came on which is normal as I have to add a little oil every now and then.  I do burn a little oil (192000 miles).  I popped my cap and noticed the dreaded foamy stuff inside which I believe is coolant in the oil.

So...here I am on Reddit trying to find out the best way for me to proceed.  I am not a mechanic and don't pretend to be.  Everything I've done on this car is because of YouTube.  :)

Things I've noticed:

* No smoke from pipes.  Even though I burn a little I don't get smoke.
* Engine seems to still run solid, even great running.  No rough idle etc.

Thanks for any advice people.  This car is a love/hate relationship for many of us I believe.  There are days it pisses me off to no end and then days I can't imagine not having it.

i just can’t win with my car,my 99’ 323i was having rough idles and i read online and on here that it could be the ccv messing up. My fuel pump was also soft failing so i decided to get one of those as well and replace it. After putting together everything and starting the car the engine starts misfiring and you can hear loud pops. the revs are all over the place and when i step on the gas nothing happens. my e46 has brought so many headaches and it’s been broken more than it has been drivable. I just want to get rid of it and trade it for a reliable honda. i just wanted to vent if this is against the rules lmk and i’ll take this down. ):,e46,1544674127,Jessebrian,35,1,True,2018-12-12
BEST WAY TO POLISH PLASTIC BUMPERS AND SIDE SKIRTS,"Howdy, good people of e46. 

I've got a 2004 330 convertible and I'm compounding and polishing for the first time. I washed---foamed it and then did traditional wash---clay barred it, then compounded with Megauiar's M105. I'm about to polish with M205 and if I have enough energy I'll wax it, too. 

But my question is:

How do I address the paint on the plastic bumper---front and rear---and what about the plastic skirting on the lower parts of the doors and sides?

What product is good to use on those?

Is it worth fixing code p0741?,"I bought a 2003 330i auto about a month ago and a couple days later this code turns up. I figured it was a simple fix but it turns out this is a common issue with the zf tranny and I was quoted around $1200 from several shops in my area. I got gypped buying the car but I guess it's my fault for not taking it for a PPI. I bought it for $3600 with 128k miles which I thought was a decent deal. Now I'm really bummed out, because I was hoping to do a suspension refresh along with some new tires. I cleared the code several times already but it keeps coming on within a day or two while driving on the freeway. A remanufactured torque converter seems to be around $300 online, and I usually do my own work on my car, but replacing this seems outside of my scope.

From what I've read, the only negative to this code is slightly worse mpg, and I won't be able to pass smog in a couple years. Has anybody here replaced a torque converter themselves? Is it easy? I only have experience changing fluids, suspension work, brakes, etc.

Is it also possible that it's not my torque converter? I have yet to take it to a mechanic, but from what I've read I almost certainly need a new torque converter.

Air Bag Light and Battery Corrosion,"Noob here, trying to sort out the little issues with my 02 convertible.

&amp;#x200B;

The air bag light is on. When I first got the car a few weeks ago I took it to the dealership to get the air bag recall work done. They said the light was on because of corrosion on the battery terminals. The negative terminal looked clean, and the main positive looked clean, so I'm assuming the issue is with this smaller positive terminal next to the main terminal. Has anyone had this issue? Also That second wire (pic attached) doesn't look like it's directly attached to the battery, do I disconnect that after I disconnect the main terminal? Lastly - whats the best way to clean that?

"Can I pick your brains? Strange electrical issues, and also INPA questions for my ‘06 325ci","Hi, so I’m a long time lurker here and the amount of knowledge for these cars in this sub is astounding.  If y’all don’t mind I’d like to ask for help....I’ll explain what I have observed, what I’ve done, and ask a few questions.

So my 325ci started draining its battery last summer.  It’s got a new alternator, and a brand new battery (twice).  After some troubleshooting I concluded that a module was not allowing the car to go to sleep.  The amperage draw on the battery with the car off and key removed climbs at a steady rate.

So for the time being I installed a 100 amp switch at the battery and simply turn it off every time I park the car.  The car is seldom driven and only has 71,000 miles.   This technique has worked well for awhile now.

In the last two weeks however, I’ve noticed the fuel gauge works intermittently, the charge indicator light come on intermittently, and just now when starting the car the radio wouldn’t play sound, wouldn’t respond to volume adjustment, and had a few “clicks” or “pops” coming through the speakers for a minute until the sound came back really loud and then seemed to work fine.  The window will drop when opening the door (as it should) but doesn’t always return to closed when the door closes, so when I manually attempt to close the window, the radio sound cuts out for a second or two, but no lights change or dim....like the radio should continue to play but the sound stops momentarily.

So I ordered the INPA and cable off eBay.  I’ve every intention of learning the software to diagnose the issues as well as to modify the car moving forward.  My question here is will INPA run on Linux?  If not I’ll have to install windows but was hoping Linux would work.

Is there anything specific I should be focusing on?  Any known common issues to help me chase these gremlins?  I’ve checked much of the wiring and grounds.  I’ve attempted to isolate individual circuits by giving the car time to sleep and then pulling individual fuses, but the amperage draw continues to climb.  I also disconnected the alternator to rule out a bad diode, but amperage draw still climbs.

Resetting the steering angle sensor/dash lights wont go out.,"My 2002 330i recently got an alignment done after replacing a tie rod end.

Coolant leak!! Possible engine swap?,"2004 BMW 330ci

So couple of days back, the radiator sign popped up in the dashboard and since I was driving along the highway and didn't have any extra coolant on me, I bit the bullet and kept heading home to take a further look. I was almost home when the there was mild smoke coming out and the engine gave up when the car was slowing down. The next day I topped up the coolant and let it rest for a day and took the car for a drive and seeing the thermostat slowly heat up again I towed the vehicle to the closest garage (not BIMMER specialized)

Fast forward, the mechanic says the radiator is shot and I arrange another and now he says the engine still isn't cooling and now has water inside and I should probably look for a second hand engine!! Pardon my ignorance, but I don't understand how can water enter the engine and if it has won't flushing the engine fix that? Do you think maybe the mechanic's lack of experience with bimmers is also partly the reason?

I have had the vehicle for 6 months with a little over 100,000kms and new into the e46 game. Your two cents are much appreciated!

TL;DR : engine gave up due to lack of coolant. Even after changing the radiator the thermostat still heats. Mechanic suggests there's water in the engine and have to get another engine :/",e46,1535863479,ShyMallu,12,1,True,2018-09-01

Wet rear passager floor,"Hello all,

After a few rainy days, both my rear floor mats were soaking. I know, that during this time I drove through a giant puddle which splashed quite a bit. I don't think it's the vapor guards as the side of floor up to the door was dry, only the floor was wet. I noticed under the car on the left side that the drainage cap was basically split, and ruined,ao I'm assuming that this is where the  water came in. Now I can't seem to find which part number that plug has, so does anyone know that part number? (couldn't seem to find it on realoem). Secondly on the right side the drain plug seemed fine, though it was not as wet as on the left side. I also do t think between the door and the floor was wet either. Should replacing the drain plug here also help with the problem?

My car also has tinted windows, would this mean that the door panals have been taken off? If so, I will need to check the vapour guards I guess.

Coolant/ac blowout,"So, driving today in the Canadian summer... I notice smoke coming out from the hood, and the temp is about 75% instead of the average 50% on the gauge. I pop the hood and see what appears to be coolant gushing out and then smoking. I check the readout in the test menu, it's about 115 c. (ac was on at this point.)

I turn it off and see if I can make it home, and the temp drops to 90, 95 c and seems to stay fairly constant (no smoke or fluids).

The kicker is the rad hoses, water pump and the impeller were changed about two years ago when it had a full on blowout (coolant down the street, low coolant light on, no coolant in the expansion tank. The expansion tank was also replaced, literally about a month ago (small cracks that were leaking over time). The bleeder screw doesn't look like it budged, and I don't see any obvious signs of detachment or breakage (from what I can see with a flashlight and the hood popped).

I was cleaning my car, and didn't notice that i had nudged the left blinker on, went to bed, woke up to a dead battery..

No big deal right?

This is where the issue starts, I can't fit the key in the keyhole, it goes in about an inch, and stops, and theres nothing i can do to make it fit, i used a small screwdriver to check if there's like a broken key or something that has the hole plugged, but no, it seems like that the door/lock was replaced by the previous owner for whatever reason.

Need some coil-over advice for my E46.,"Hey everyone, I recently got some coil-overs for my car. And I just need some information before i go ahead and install them. So I have a 2003 E46 Sedan. It is on stock suspension (as you can see in the link below). I was given some coil-overs and lowering springs. They came off an E46 Coupe.

Can I install them even though they are different brands?

Need help to determine damage,"Monday night, I was driving back from class and hit a large rock-like object in the middle of the road with the front-right wheel going about 60mph on a one lane access road. The impact caused a hole on the inside of the wheel and for the side skirt to pop off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did get a new wheel and put the side skirt back on, but I noticed that my car has symptoms of other damages. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, what I've noticed is: 

The steering wheel doesn't feel parallel to the dash (although I just may be paranoid)

The alignment is off (of course) 

The front right wheel is leaning in, as if it has negative camber

The car is leaning toward the front-right side 

The area where the suspension attatches to the body under the hood seems damaged. Pic for reference ===&gt;([https://imgur.com/a/4M4Ip6F](https://imgur.com/a/4M4Ip6F)) Sorry for the poor quality. These were taken the same night.

how long will the m54 last before it needs a rebuild/replacement?,"Hi guys

I'm currently driving a 330ci with 130k miles. The car runs fine and I've been replacing various engine parts over the years to keep it working well. The thing is, I love the car and would wish that it'd last forever but I've just been learning recently about engine rebuilds and I'm worried about how many more miles the car will do before the cylinders need to be re-bored or even replaced. I've read posts on e46fanatics of guys with 400k+ mileage e46s but I'm not sure if they also had to rebuild their engine, then again I've also read one post where a bunch of users call the OP an idiot for even considering the idea of boring his engine lol.

Your opinion - BMW 320D automatic sedan with 220km. Whats next - and how to add music. Yes I'm a noob.,"Just got this - know the previous owner, he's a friend and very reliable with the maintenances and stuff. 

I like older cars. I like the feel of them, and I really enjoy driving that bathtub. So I want to keep it properly and enjoy it for a long while.

Single problem with it - the sunroof. Already manually set it straight and disconnected the button, that's going to stay where it is. Opened, took a look at the mechanism to repair... its too finicky. Too much to go wrong. Better it be off.

What next?

 - Where can I find tips on upkeep?

 - What can I do maintenance wise that will pay off in lifetime?

 - The automatic gears, how reliable are those? Any tips to keep them from going bust?

 - Should I add those diesel additives to clean injectors, does it help?

 - What are the major repair milestones ahead?

 - What sort of mileage can I expect out of it if well cared for?

 - The interior is looking old (yeah no shit sherlock). Any suggestions on cleaning stuff? Simple fixes or stuff I can order online to make it better?

 - I want to give it some new music. Has it got something I can connect an mp3 player to, or the phone? Or should I just replace the entire radio/cassette player thing?

 - Can those engines get ""boosted"" at the control level, to give it a little extra ""breathe""? A friend with the 2008 version (E90?) did that to his, and he got a boost and actually improved his fuel consumption.

I'm thinking if the engine is a bit stronger, it will have to ""work"" the automatic gears a bit less. Am I totally wrong?

Note: if it reduces life, I don't want to do it. I'm not a break-the-limits driver.

Any other tips?

Proverbial oil thread (what to use),"Most of the forum posts about this are several years old now, and catered to the USA, so I figured let's kick up the hornet's nest!

&amp;#x200B;

What do you use to fill your BMW up with in terms of oil? **The e46 manual states SAE 5W30 or 5W40, and an API of SH or higher**. A quick google shows it's also recommended to use a BMW LL-01 certified oil (if not using BMW brand oil). 

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER...the aftermarket oils (not interested in buying BMW oil, my car has 330k kms on it and is winter driven/isn't babied) with LL-01 specs are largely 0W40/0W30 (with the exception of the Valvoline 5W30, which I can't find anywhere in Canada). [(Recommended oils.)](https://www.bimmershops.com/oil-for-bmw)

&amp;#x200B;

I've often used Mobil1 5W30, but I see guys/gals ragging on it for not being LL-01/having the wrong HTHS ratio. Can't say I've ever had any issues (apart from the classic BMW guzzling oil/leaking oil, which is par for the course). HOWEVER—Mobil1 5W30 has an API of SN/SM (higher than SH!).

[HELP] 330i Touring - Sitting lower on left rear,"  Hello all,

Just found scuff marks on my left rear tire. Measuring the sides, the left is about 1-2cm lower. I've not owned the car for a long time, and i bought it with MTS Technik coilovers. I took of both back wheels to check the springs, and they were fine, no cracks. I’ve also pushed over the dampers to see if it bounces and it seems fine there as well. I’ve added new rubber blocks in between the rear springs as well. I checked over the rear springs as well and there were no adjustments to be done there either. 

What other factors could make the car sit lower on the rear left? I know originally that the left side actually sits higher than the right. Could the rear trail arm bushings cause this?

Need help with suspension! pt.2,"A few weeks ago, I posted about hitting debris in the highway and it damaging my suspension. 

Turns out that it broke the wheel and has my new wheel leaning in as if it has negative camber. I've gotten it looked at by a friend at a BMW dealership and it seems like tie rods, control arms, and steering rack aren't bent, but I'm still having trouble figuring out what is causing the wheel to lean in. Also, there's also a creaking noise coming from said side when I turn the wheel. Any speculation on what you guys think it may be? 

The car is still drivable but I'm wearing out the tire. I'm planning on having it looked at much more thoroughly this weekend, but being a full-time student and working full time doesn't leave much time for your car :( 

The end goal is to replace the suspension after all the damages are fixed. Do you all have any suggestions on what type of suspension I should be looking to invest in? I'm only using it as a daily driver. A plus would be having enough room to add spacers or wider tires to get them even with the fenders. THANKS",e46,1538067364,crismissingtheh,6,2,True,2018-09-27
E46 Touring - Battery Dead and Locked Out,"Hi all,

First time posting in this sub. Few months ago I bought a 325i Touring to use as a winter car (my first BMW, coming from a background of Japanese cars). Yesterday I went to try to start it (battery was still connected) but I think the battery is dead, no response when clicking key fob.

I tried to manually unlock the door to pop the hood but I tried all sorts of twisting and turning, pulling handle while/during/after turning the key, and nothing I can do seems to get the door to open. The wagon also doesn't have a keyhole in the trunk.

After some Googling online, looks like my best bet is to pop out the kidney and unlatch the hood, then hook up a booster/jumper cables. So if I do that, then the battery would draw power and then I should be able to unlock the car, get in, and start the car, is that correct?

Just wanted to see if I'm on the right track, and am also open to any other ideas as well. Thanks in advance!

I should also note that the car is parked at somebody else's place, underground in the parking lot of their condo, so I want to get a foolproof plan all figured out before make an arrangement to get to the car again.",e46,1538074471,Windu1,6,3,True,2018-09-27

All the problems I have for the past month.. Can someone help me please?,"Hello, 

At first I had an accident so I got a new bumper, the mechanic didn't install the wheel splash guard/shield, anyway the ambient temperature sensor fell from the car and started scratching on the asphalt soon after I would see the cluster beeping as the temperature jumped to -50 C, so I took the broken sensor off and since I live in an awesome country where no mechanic has parts for e46 I couldn't replace it yet, soon after hell would break loose, I don't know if the sensor thing is related or not, anyway after a week or so I was driving and when I stopped and parked the car I noticed that the cluster dials were stuck I didn't think much of it but when I came but they were still stuck and even after accelerating the'd be stuck, and there was no dashlight as well as the indicators/emergency light wouldn't tick/beep while they were on and while in reverse the sensors wouldn't beep at all, after a day or two I tried to switch on the AC and it wouldn't turn on at all. Soon after new crap started happening like the sunroof would sometimes not work, my key fob didn't have a functioning buttons on it so I ordered a new one and I got it checked and they said it was working well but it wouldn't program (wouldn't lock first time) I mention this because I heard unable to lock through key might have something to do with it. I read on removing the battery for a day and I did that only reset the cluster dials but all other problems ensued,  used the ""9 test"" from the dashboard to test the battery I had a 11 and when the car was on it jumped to 14. We have no professional electricians or even mechanics for that matter, so I would really appreciate if someone could help me out on this.

2006 325ci defeating me,"I recently picked up a used 2006 bmw 325ci with the dreaded m56. I’m determined to get this thing fixed. The car has two codes p0171 (bank 1 lean) and p0174 (bank 2 lean).

Then while at a red light the car will run fine for about 30 seconds then start to miss fire and hesitate badly from a stop. Along with this the car seems to warm up relatively fast and the coolant tank warning light will illuminate. I’ve also had the car over heat rarely while at a stop but go right back down within seconds after I start too accelerate. I know the coolant temp sensor is related to air fuel ratios and torque converter lock out! Was seeing if anyone has seen anything like this here before I rip into it or to know if I have two completely separate problems on my hands. FYI I have cleaned the maf, replaced any leaking vaccum hose I could find, and replaced transmission pan gasket and filter.

So far:

Clutch disk, pressure plate, pilot bearing, throw out/release bearing, clutch fork, clutch release arm spring, clutch release bearing guide tube, and a clutch pivot pin.

I've also got a rear main seal, six bolts for it, crank seal cover gasket, gasket sealer, and an oil pan gasket.

I picked up a new oil filter, oil filter gasket, oil pan bolt, oil pan washer, two oil filter housing o-rings, and seven quarts of Mobil 1 0W40 oil.

Two engines mounts and two transmission mounts with the eight different nuts.

Shift lever mount, transmission selector rod pin, selector rod bushing, lock rings, shift rod circlips, selector rod washers, top shifter bearing, left bearing pin, and a front shift lever bushing, two fill/drain plugs, and two liters of Febi 75w80 fluid.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything I'm missing? I'd hate to button it all up and realize I was right next to an odd-ball bushing I neglected.",e46,1539053369,D0gDay,3,1,True,2018-10-08
E46 m3 caught on fire while parked,"Hey,

I am trying to figure out what happened about 2 hours ago when my 2002 bmw m3 caught on fire.

Here’s the story, I bought the car last year and never noticed any electrical issue and my car had been parked in my driveway since Friday.

On Monday night I was watching tv, it was raining really hard and there was a lot of lightnings. 

My car alarm went off, when I looked throughs the window I noticed all my lights were going on and off in a weird patern, but the alarm had actually stopped. I kept looking for a few seconds and noticed smoke coming out of the side grill (drivers side). I ran to the car and as soon as I opened the door, a good size flame emerged between the dash and the windshield directly in front of the steering wheel.

My father had a fire extinguisher so he was able to stop the fire in seconds, but I assume there is some serious damage to the electrical system and other parts. We were very lucky to have noticed and stopped it so quickly, specially considering the car was about 2 feet from the house. 

We unplugged the battery, fire department came and I’ll be calling the insurance company in the morning.

Any advice?
Thanks!

"First time buyer, E46 rattling my brain!","Just bought myself a BMW 318CI SE and having some issues with the car that I do not understand! The car seems fine, runs and drives great. After a medium journey (1/2hour to an hour drive) and shutting the car off, I have had to go back and start it up again only to get an orange EML and the car revving on its own up and down with no throttle response when I press the pedal in. If I leave the car to cool a little, it will start up again no problems! This has happened twice since I purchased the car about a month ago. Could it be down to radiator fan failure or anything like that? And how might I test that various components are working as they should? From what I can see it seems to be down to some sort of overheating issue but god knows what it is!

03' 320i Wipers and Driver side seat warmer stopped working (probably short circuit),"Hey guys, not sure if this is the right place to post this and I'd gladly take advice on where to find answers but I've been looking everywhere and can't seem to find help with my issue.

So, a couple months ago (around 5) I realised my wipers stopped working. Sometimes they would turn on and work fine and other times they would simply not work. I also realised that if I pressed the seat warmer button for the driver's side it would just blink and not work, but the passenger side worked fine. 

I took the car to a mechanic and he said he couldn't find whats wrong. He said he tested the motor on another car and it was working fine. He also said that he thinks the G5 module is broken. I'm not sure if that's the case because locking and unlocking is fine and the car doesn't have any other symptoms.

When I got the car back from him I saw that the wipers were working but they were going the opposite way (from rest position they would go straight down). So I took the blades off and ran a full cycle so that they would go up. That worked until I hit a bump and for some reason I tested to see if that caused them to break and it did.

I posted a video on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVnNjYestWc) of the symptoms.
Anyone have any clue? I've also checked the fuses for them and they seem fine to me. I can provide pictures.

"Best photos I have right now, but does anyone in Europe/UK want to buy our Bulgarian registered 2014 320d 6spd manual? Delivery possible (from Rotterdam).","I apologise if this sub is North America only. I've just come across it today. 

This old girl has one more week on the registration (Bulgarian) so I need to sell it or put it under a tarp somewhere. Not lying though... looking at all the other wagons here has made me want to hang onto it. If it's of any real value to other enthusiasts, I'll probably just avoid the hassle.

The car has a good service history (still in the glovebox). Before we started with it we had someone do a full service, plus all the usual hacks that you do to a Diesel E46 (I have the full details somewhere). Then we drove from Bulgaria to Portugal, and then on to the Netherlands. 

It's in relatively good condition cosmetically. Especially when it comes to the common issues with the e46.

* All windows work completely.
* Front pillar lining is mostly still attached nicely.
* Scratching on the console is not so bad.
* Very clean fabric throughout.
* No condensation/yellowing/cracking in any of the light covers (that I have ever noticed).
* Badge is not flaking.
* Body is pristine except for a 10cm x 10cm scrape on the back bumper.
* Door handles are still sturdy.
* No white smoke.

Issues:

* Sticky indicators in the cold (presumably an easy fix that I haven't bothered looking at during the summer).
* There's a vibration between 120 &amp; 140 that is annoying on long drives.

Ohter points:

* The roof box is not sold yet, so it's possible to have it included.
* It does not have cruise control or the steering wheel with buttons.

If there is interest, I can get better photos and write up some more complete detail.

Frequent CEL and Intermittent Tail Light Warning on 2004 325XI,"Hey everyone,

My 2004 325XI is sitting just under 220k kilometres (137k miles) and I'm noticing some problems with the Check Engine Light and the the taillight warning light on the dash. I'll explain the problems below and want to know if any of you have had the same/similar problems and maybe how to go about fixing them?

1. CEL: If I'm out driving for a bit of time or every 1000km or so, my CEL will pop on but there are seemingly no problems with the engine. When I get home and hook up my OBD2 reader, it comes back as either one of two problems:
   1. ENGINE RUNNING TOO LEAN - I have a cone air filter installed that is aftermarket but I did not install the full cold air intake. I want to believe that this is the cause of the problem as maybe the mass airflow sensor is out of balance from the stock air filter? For the record, I notice that this problem is more frequent when the temperature is colder outside (below 10 degrees Celcius/50 Fahrenheit)
   2. COOLANT TEMPERATURE BELOW THERMOSTAT REGULATING TEMPERATURE - Would this be more of a sensor failure or could there be a bigger problem at hand? I figure that below is better than above

2. Tail Light Warning: So on the dashboard, we have that little diagram of the car that shows when a light is burnt out or a door is open. Every now and then the tail light will come up as burnt out for a bit, but then will disappear and work again. I changed the bulbs the first few times but the problem kept persisting. There was a recall I guess on the electrical plugin for the taillights that was completed before my ownership (I've had the car for a couple years) but when replacing the bulbs I found that the plugin was still running hot and burning. What would be the fix for this, as in what components need to be replaced? Would the entire tail light unit need to be replaced or just the little electrical pin connector where it's been running hot?

Error Codes – Heating Thermostat &amp; Lamda regulator deviation/control limit,"Hey  guys—using an OBD scanner on my 2002 e46 sedan, these fault codes  populated, and keep coming up even though I clear them. I can't find  anything online about what these are, let alone how to fix them.

No Coolant in Expansion Tank,"I realized I had a coolant leak on Monday so I ordered a new, expansion tank, upper radiator house and thermostat (peake tool indicated it was stuck open).  These parts are coming on Friday which is when I intend to replace them.  However, before I drove home today I checked my coolant and the expansion tank was bone dry.  That said, my temp gage remained in the cool during my short commute home.  Should I stop driving the car until I can replace the parts on Friday? Or do you think I can squeeze a few more days of driving as long as I monitor the temp gauge?",e46,1540357883,abyrne45,13,1,True,2018-10-23

Help me choose between two clutches,"So I have a 325ci that I just use as a beater, I don’t plan on modifying past plain bolt ons and it does not get abused. It’s time to change the clutch and I would rather stick to something cheap and up to OEM standards. That being I get a really great discount from autozone and they have two to offer. They are branded duralast but I asked them who made the parts for them and this is what I got.

Thank you for your patience regarding this matter. Please be kindly advised that according to our category managers part No.NU31440 is the OE design and that is supplied from AMS.

"[Emissions] Multiple systems ""NOT READY"" when getting emissions test done. How do I reset?","I have an old 2002 325ci I drive to work. It was failing emissions tests and I ended up having to get the thermostat replaced. Now the evaporative systems and catalyst are ""Not Ready"" when going for emissions tests. 

I've driven close to 3,000 miles since having the thermostat replaced. Check Engine light has been off the whole time. Youtube suggests a long, drawn out procedure for resetting the drive cycle. Is there any way I can quickly reset the OBDII so I can get this thing to pass its emissions test?

Who else has a problem with the key remote unlocking their doors?,"Hi everybody. Just subscribed to this sub. I have two e46s, an '04 325 and an '02 M3. I've owned the 325 for much longer than the M and its always had this funny problem where the key fob would intermittently refuse to unlock the doors (or conversely, the doors would intermittently refuse to listen to the key. Never quite figured out which way it went.). Its an on and off problem I've had for a long time and the center locking switch dysfunctions concurrently when it happens. The doors still unlock find with the door handle from the inside and the doors always lock with the key. I thought it was just a problem I was having with my 325 and a shop once said something about a possible faulty control module that sounded way to expensive to deal with, so I paid it no mind and went on with life. But then recently my M3 started doing the exact same thing. It's always the passenger side on both cars and now I'm starting to wonder if this is an e46 quirk. The 325 has kinda had the life of a beater--was my daily driver for years, has high mileage (a bit shy of 200k), hasn't been garaged--though I've taken care of it with regular maintenance and body work as needed (started getting a little rusty under the wheel wells, spend a few grand having all that repaired... not that any of this has anything to do with whatever controls the locking mechanisms). My M3 on the other hand has had a cushy life at 89k miles, regular dealer maintenance, and a lovely home in a garage since new with one previous owner and has spent most of its life as a weekend toy, so when it started doing the same exact thing as my 325, it made my brow raise Dwayne Johnson style. Anybody have any idea what's really going on?

And just for fun, here's some pictures of my babies :)
